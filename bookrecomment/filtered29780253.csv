 Born a Crime is Noah's story of birth and survival under South African apartheid rule, the chaos after that rule fell and how his light skin (but not too light), dark skin (but not too dark), luck and nerve served and failed him. Each chapter, you read about how he engages in misfortune and adventure only to see one of his friends or family members be claimed by the oppressive governmental forces or the specter those forces cast, and just when you think it's going to be Noah himself, the finger of fate touches someone close to him. 
 The entire book is a loving tribute to his mother, who if even half the things were true, sounds like a model for all mothers and an outspoken work for reforming how we approach domestic abuse. He gives an unflinching eye on how far can you support someone who's willing to live in a bad relationship. 
 There's also enough visceral details on what poor and starving people use for food to last a reader a very long while. 
 What's definitely noticeable are the tales left behind in the margins: what happened to Teddy who went to jail for eating chocolates, how Trevor helped raise his two brothers after a harrowing event, and the challenges of becoming a comedian in South Africa and eventually the big question: how did he get out of South Africa? which is a recurring theme but unsatisfactorily never answered. The sad effect of these omissions is that it makes the book seem narcissistic at times which he readily cops to in the book, so that may be the truth. 
 Overall, while I feel enriched for his story and I'm happy he's made it out of that place, I like him a little less as a person.","Fri Nov 25 10:41:07 -0800 2016","Tue Dec 06 12:27:48 -0800 2016","Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

 This is the story of his childhood/adolescence and growing up with his single mother-- a story of surviving life in South Africa and being treated as a second class citizen. We learn about his family and what he did in high school. This book does not go past the first couple of years out of high school--- nor does it touch on him becoming a comedian, but it is really well written and gives a good idea about life in South Africa for a ""colored"" child. 
 I hope he continues to write--- I would love how he went from a DJ in SA to a late night tv host in NYC....

 As I said, I listened to this on audio book, which I recommend. Noah is narrating it and I always like when that's the case with autobiographies. He does a great job, and hearing him imitate accents and talking in different langagues gives life to the whole thing. 
 I think this autobiography was really skillfully crafted. The way he jumped back and forth in time, making associations, telling little side-anecdotes, but always driving the chapter home in the ens was impressive. I also really enjoyed the topic: I know very little about South Africa and Apartheid, so I was eager to learn. And so I did, thanks to the way this was told. 
 Noah found a great balance between political, personal, funny and emotional and I am glad that I took the chance on him.","Sun Jan 29 22:39:34 -0800 2017","Mon Feb 06 12:00:59 -0800 2017","Mon Feb 06 12:00:59 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 I only rated it three stars because I'm not comfortable with some of the timeline and authenticity of this book. I was astonished to learn, after reading, that Trevor Noah's mother converted to Judaism when he was a child. He had a Bar Mitzvah that was ill-attended. Was he unable to reconcile this part of his mother's life with the rest of his story? I want to know whether she was, indeed, still calling on the name of Jesus by the time he was 19 (at the end of the book). 
 South African reviewers question whether he was really hidden away until the age of six; when anti-mixing laws were overturned when he was two years old. I can accept his version of these facts, because this was the impression he had when he was a child. I still recommend this book, with the understanding that his reality may not have been the average reality of a mixed-race child in South Africa during that time period.","Fri Mar 24 11:07:42 -0700 2017","Fri Mar 24 11:17:24 -0700 2017","","",0,0,""

 -- Trevor Noah, Born a Crime 
 Just finished listening to Trevor Noah's book ""born a crime"" which is narrated by Trevor Noah and well, it is a damn good book. Trevor has a masterful way of using humor to make strong and powerful statements about the way he and others view race and identity. Through his humor and careful selection of poignant moments in his life, Trevor is able to give us insight into the world of a boy trying to find his way in a world where he was born a crime. This is the first audiobook I have listened completely and while I find his stories relatable and clever; the intimacy of hearing these words spoken from his own voice was what made this experience more powerful.This book made me laugh, made me think and also made me cry. Everyone should give it a chance.","Tue Dec 06 14:19:50 -0800 2016","Sat Jan 14 17:10:09 -0800 2017","Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 -0800 2016",2,0,""

 His is the epitome of survival and overcoming obstacles and transcending barriers...and this became a welcome partner on my long runs and it uplifted my spirit.

 I highly recommend the audiobook, because he is the narrator for the story and as a comedian and the person everything actually happened to, he makes the story come alive.

 Firstly, I didn't know much of Trevor Noah prior to reading ""Born A Crime"" but now I feel like a buddy of his who has been alongside with him in his youth. Except let's be honest, I couldn't possibly be because of how unique his perspective and coming-of-age story is (and that I'll never be cool enough to be part of his entourage). His personal accounts were very anecdotal, jumping through different ages of his life, which sometimes made it hard pin-pointing at what stage of his childhood it was happening in yet that never felt like an obstacle in wanting to know more about Noah's life. He is so genuine in his eloquence in conveying the thoughts and reasonings of his younger self, which ultimately provides a glimpse into who Trevor Noah is as a person now. 
 Secondly, I didn't know much of South Africa's history outside of the Apartheid, and even then, my knowledge of the Apartheid was superficially slim. ""Born A Crime"" is of the voice of someone who lived through that period, and not just any voice, but of a voice of someone straddling and struggling amongst multiple identities as a mixed child. Noah shares his keen insight into the circumstances in which he was born into within a much larger context of a country and her people looking to establish their own identity after times of turmoil. 
 There are just so many of Noah's anecdotes that I want to talk to with people. About that time his mom threw him out of a moving vehicle, or the one about his very eventful prom night, maybe about his CD-burning business or that DJ dance job with Hitler at a Jewish school, and definitely about his mom's miracle. There is plenty to take away from ""Born A Crime"", from the everlasting ties between a mother and son, to the injustices inflicted on the vulnerable by the society they are meant to be a part of, even to something that boils down to this: ""I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being.""","Thu Dec 01 05:38:39 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 26 13:49:58 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 26 13:54:30 -0800 2016","Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016",3,0,""

 I loved this book. Noah illustrates his complicated childhood in apartheid South Africa through a narrative that is all together witty, historical, political, comical, and serious. I listened to it on Audible, which he reads, and I'm sure I made a good choice. I am both left in awe by the insidiousness of apartheid and the triumph of the human spirit-- notably Noah's and his mother's. It also gives me new appreciation for the clever commentary Noah offers as host of the Daily Show, as he has had such varied experiences to draw from in his young life.","Fri Dec 23 23:27:13 -0800 2016","Fri Dec 23 23:43:33 -0800 2016","Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

 Trevor has the ability to take us by the hand, introduce us to his most intimate relationships with humor and love.

And-at least I did- smelled the leaves, felt the dust under my feet, heard their music, their voices. I even had bouts of happiness as I sensed the kindness and protection family and networks can give. 
 But most of all I was left with his wonderful mother whom I adore, enjoyed and laughed at her, admired her love of life, her attitude to keep on going thanking every step of the way her connection with whoever she believes in. 
 It is a great testimony of coping passionate and lovingly with all kinds of adversities. Standing up as they face injustice,discrimination, violence, poverty, and doing it with integrity and humor.

 This was my first foray into the audio book world, and man, was it good. Narrated by Trevor Noah himself, he takes you into an incredible journey back in time during South Africa's apartheid. The different dialects, accents, languages, voices and inflections he uses during his narration are a thing of wonder and beauty. He transports you into his world, he makes you feel everything, and you will find yourself laughing, shaking your head in incredulity and weeping tears of pain and heartbreak - and in no particular order. 
 I never thought of myself as a huge fan of Trevor Noah. I never watched his stand up comedy, and only watched a handful of episodes since he took over from Jon Stewart. I thought he was intelligent and entertaining, but no Jon Stewart. I picked up this book after hearing about it from my sister, who couldn't stop praising it. When I did purchase it, she insisted I listen to the audio book, promising me that it was a 100 times better when you listen to it because you get to truly experience his world and his childhood. So I did. 
 Trevor Noah became my friend during my long commutes to and from work. I was engrossed in his life, and fell in love with his mother, who is my hero in so many ways now. 
 Trevor Noah has a knack at explaining things to you in uncomplicated terms so you leave knowing more than you ever have about pre- and post- Apartheid in South Africa and about the complex system that divided people (white, black and colored), and about the communities he grew up in. He allows you to listen to his story and come to your conclusions, make your own judgments, and root for whomever you chose to root for. I always rooted for his mother, and for him. 
 I admit that I enjoyed his early years a lot more than the later ones. I thoroughly enjoyed his interactions with his mother as a child, their conversations, their arguments and their love for each other was a joy to listen to. Being a mother to a naughty boy myself, I found myself relating to his mother in many ways and laughing out loud at how his naughtiness was dealt with. I loved their conversations about Jesus, and you could immediately tell that Noah was quite a clever boy from very early on. The letters they wrote each other when they were fighting about something were simultaneously hilarious and endearing. I cannot begin to tell you how much I loved this book. 
 The last few chapters, when he gets into the business of hustling, were interesting, but I felt it went on for a little too long. It also seemed slightly abrupt how he went from hustling and DJ'ing to comedy. There was never any explanation on how he got into comedy, why he chose that path, or how he started. I would have liked to know more about that part of his life, because we know that when he gets the call from his brother Andrew at the end, he's already doing stand-up, but we don't know when or how it began. 
 The end tore me to pieces. The pain and heartbreak in his voice made my heart twist and squeeze itself and my eyes flood with unshed tears. 
 A beautiful story, told by a wonderful human being. I have a lot of respect for someone who has been through so much pain and struggle to come out a successful and humble person, and to be able to look back at his life and see it from a comedic perspective.","Sat Jul 15 10:31:35 -0700 2017","Tue Oct 17 00:28:16 -0700 2017","Sat Sep 23 23:59:55 -0700 2017","Sat Jul 15 10:31:35 -0700 2017",9,2,"False"

 So, I don't read a lot of non-fiction or memoirs. It's just not what I normally gravitate toward. However, I've been wanting to dip my toes into more of these and I really like Trevor Noah. I've of course seen him on the Daily Show, and also several stand-up specials he's done where he speaks relatively openly about his upbringing. 
 This book expands on that in an incredibly candid way. We learn about the history of South Africa and the disgusting practice of institutionalized racism (Apartheid). We learn about how he was able to navigate this society where he never felt like he belonged because of the circumstance surrounding his birth. And we learn about his amazing relationship with his mother, a woman who is strict, stubborn, determined, loving, devout, and fierce in her convictions. 
 I loved the way he structured this book. It skips around to different time periods in his life, but it never feels choppy or confusing. There is a really steady pacing and the stories tie back into each other really nicely. 
 I also loved the tone of this book. There are some truly awful things described in this book. I can't even imagine what it must have been like to actually grow up like this. The fact that he is able to relate these stories in such a straightforward and candid manner while not coming off as dismissive or flippant is very compelling. The intense things are still intense. But for him, that was just the way it was, and the book's tone reflects that very well, in my opinion.

 Noah's recollections of growing up during and after apartheid are bracing and thought-provoking, but also funny and infinitely readable. Especially in the UK, comedy can be the preserve of the privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate, so it was refreshing to read a comic memoir from someone who's actually Lived A Life. 
 My criticisms of Born a Crime are basically the same as everyone else's: the timeline jumps around in a way that's confusing, and too many of the stories have the feeling of standup bits, hitting the big laugh and then ending abruptly. I also could have done with a mite more about Noah's post-18 life. Late in the memoir, when Noah is an adult, he pays for his mother's hospital treatment, and my reaction was, wait he's rich now? how/when did he get rich? Lil bit confusing. 
 Nitpicks aside, this is a rare book that's educational and entertaining in equal measure. Recommended.

He tells a good story and he had a lot of good stories to tell. 
 I know very little about South Africa so my favorite sections of the book were those where Trevor spoke about his country. The racial classifications under Apartheid were NUTS. The whole system was just terrible. Trevor explains it clearly and even humorously at times. I thought the parts dealing with the language situation - 11 official languages!- was fascinating. It is impressive he speaks so many languages. His polyglot status also lends itself to several funny stories. I think my favorite was overhearing some guys planning to mug him and Trevor being able to answer them in their own language, making a joke and thus defusing the situation. 
 I wish the book has talked about how he got his start in the entertainment business. How on earth did he make the leap from selling counterfeit goods in the ghetto to hosting an American tv show??? That is quite the change! Maybe he is saving those stories for another memoir down the road? I also wanted to know what has happened to his mom & brothers.

 I never expected a memoir to, at the same time, challenge my views, teach me and move me as much as this book did, but it happened, and I love Trevor for it. It's a lesson on the importance of family, community and empathy. It is a lesson for anyone who, like me, had no idea about what life under apartheid or in the ghetto actually meant, of what the conditions are and of what that culture entails. It's also a lesson on how perseverance and optimism can lift people from the toughest environments, against all odds and in spite of any cultural or economical disadvantages. 
 And finally, it's a lesson for memoirs, because Trevor Noah actually has a story to tell. Unlike the countless other toilet-book time-waster celebrity-memoirs on the market that are just filled with silly stories and celebrity anecdotes, this is a true bildungsroman in every sense of the word.","Sun Jan 01 02:15:40 -0800 2017","Thu Oct 05 03:25:14 -0700 2017","Wed Jan 11 14:34:14 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 -0800 2017",1,1,"False"

Born to mixed race parents, Trevor had to learn to lie at an early age as his birth truly was a crime against the government. I did not realize all of the racial categories that apartheid designated---especially the huge differences between colored and black. People were constantly asked to defend their color. Getting out of the ghetto was not even a dream for many families/colors. 
 Trevor explained apartheid as apart- hate. ""You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all."" Trevor's strong will and hustling prowess allowed him to survive the streets. At times, it was his mother that almost took him down. She often beat her lessons into him but it was easy to see that she was his strongest positive influence. His survival and eventual success was thanks to her. ""My mom did what school didn't. She taught me how to think."" I was frustrated with her when she kept letting Abel, Trevor's stepfather, beat her. It wasn't until I saw how the policemen treated her that I understood. Talk about a good old boy's club. Men protected men. When Trevor questioned her about why she stayed she replied that he would kill her if she left. As the story unfolded, I understood that fear. 
 This book unfolds in a way that kept my interest throughout. There's no pretense or mincing of words to save face. In addition, there were some golden nuggets that I need to hold on to. Here are just a few: 
 ""You tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine and depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited."" 
 ""Language, even more than color, defines who you are to people."" (I had no idea how many languages/dialects existed in South Africa during this time.) 
 ""People say give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime."" What they don't say is, ""and it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod."" 
 ""In society we do horrible things to one another because we don't see the person it affects."" 
 ""Comfort provides a floor but also a ceiling."" 
 ""Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give another human being."" 
 ""Relationships are built in the silences.""","Sat Mar 04 09:12:02 -0800 2017","Sat Mar 04 09:45:12 -0800 2017","Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",4,0,""

So I was already predisposed to like this memoir when I picked it up, but I think it could entertain the average open-minded nonfan as well. 
 Each chapter opens with a page about the history of colonization, oppression and apartheid that South Africa was steeped in over centuries of European rule. About half-way through, these mini-history lessons became less general and more personal in how they applied to him, but not less informative. I have never learned so much broad history from a such scant offerings. 
 His breakdown of the relationship between racism and language is beautiful and succinct: ""If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu. If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn't look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you."" 
 Trevor's love for his mother comes through clearly and constantly, even when he is numerating all the ways they clashed (his mischievous ways as a child, his devil's advocate stance in regard to her piousness, etc.) He foreshadowed the violence they would face at the hands of his stepfather early on and that hung over every interaction he wrote about her like a vulture waiting to swoop in - it was bittersweet to read about the funny moments he had with his mother, knowing she would soon be a victim of domestic abuse. The acknowledgement of both his original anger at why she stayed and his ignorance of how abusive relationships worked is unusual, but I think it exemplifies the good man he grew up to be, the good man his mother raised against so many odds.

An insightful and often funny memoir about a mixed-race child growing up in Johannesburg during apartheid. He lived a life of unbelievable racism, poverty, and violence, yet is able to offer a collection of life stories that pulls you in and doesn't let go until the final page.

This was heartbreaking and exhilarating all at once. I adore his mother and wish I could offer her one huge knuckle bump for what all that she stood up for and did for herself and her son. So many take aways and reminders for me of just how blessed I am to have been born in the circumstances that make up my life. 
 The things I must remember: 
 ""Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says, 'We're the same'. A language barrier says, 'We're different'. The architects of apartheid understood this. Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were separated not just physically but by language as well. Because of this, we'd fall into the trap the government had set for us and fight among ourselves, believing that we were different. The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite: convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it's easily tricked. If a person who doesn't look like you but speaks like you, your brain short-circuits because your racism program has none of those instructions in the code."" 
 ""So many incidents in my life made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people. Maybe I didn't look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you."" 
 ""My mom did what school didn't. She taught me to think."" 
 ""My mom raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid - not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts matters."" 
 ""The only authority my mother recognized was God's. God is love and the Bible is truth - everything else was up for debate. She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her."" 
 ""Relationships are built in the silences."" 
 ""The hood was strangely comforting, but comfort can be dangerous. Comfort provides a floor but also a ceiling."" 
 ""I know you see me as some crazy old bitch nagging at you,"" she said, ""but you forget the reason I ride you so hard and give you so much shit is because I love you. Everything I have ever done I've done from a place of love. If I don't punish you, the world will punish you even worse. The world doesn't love you. If the police get you, the police don't love you. When I beat you, I'm trying to save you. When they beat you, they're trying to kill you."" 
 ""I grew up in a world of violence, but I myself was never violent at all. Yes, I played pranks and set fires and broke windows, but I never attacked people. I never hit anyone. I was never angry. I just didn't seem myself that way. My mother had exposed me to a different world than the one she grew up in. She bought me the books she never got to read. She took me to the schools that she never got to go to. I immersed myself in those worlds and I came back looking at the world a different way. I saw that not all families are violent. I saw the futility of violence, the cycle that just repeats itself, the damage that's inflicted on people that they in turn inflict on others. I saw, more than annoying, that relationships are not sustained by violence but by love. Love is a creative act. When you love someone you create a new world for them. My mother did that for me, and with the progress I made and the things I learned, I came back and created a new world and a new understanding for her. After that, she never raised her hand to her children again."" 
 ""You're lucky to be alive,"" I told her, ""I still can't believe you didn't have any health insurance."" 
 ""Oh but I do have insurance,"" she said. 
 ""You do?"" 
 ""Yes. Jesus."" 
 ""Jesus?"" 
 ""Jesus."" 
 ""Jesus is your health insurance?"" 
 ""If God is with me, who can be against me?"" 
 ""Okay, Mom."" 
 ""Trevor, I prayed. I told you I prayed. I don't pray for nothing."" 
 ""You know,"" I said, ""for once I cannot argue with you. The gun, the bullets - I can't explain any of it. So I will give you that much."" Then I couldn't resist teasing her with one last little jab. ""But where was your Jesus to pay your hospital bill, hmmm?""I know for a fact that He didn't pay that."" 
 She smiled and said, ""You're right. He didn't. But he blessed me with a son who did.""","Fri Feb 10 11:51:20 -0800 2017","Sun Mar 12 22:49:55 -0700 2017","Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",1,0,""

 However, I was in love with only his work - his stand up shows, his work with The Daily Show (which I watch daily). I didn't really research his life, except to see if he has a girlfriend (which he does ). Which is why things that he said in his book were so shocking to me. I knew he lived in apartheid, I knew about his family and him being mixed - I just didn't understand the ramifications of having to live through that. 
 Having read the book I feel as though I'm in love again, but this time with his mother. What a pillar of strength, a force to be reckoned with, a rebel and a crusader of her times and ours! Basically, I love his family. 
 There were times I laughed and laughed, times when I was solemn and times I simply bawled. The painting that Trevor Noah painted of his life was fresh and you didn't have to look too closely to see the cracks, the bumps. But it was these cracks and bumps that made the painting so beautiful.

 If you are looking for a glitzy Hollywood memoir, move along. This is not it. In fact, it doesn't bring him in the U.S. or on television. This is his story of growing up the child of mixed race parents during the waning years of apartheid and beyond. 
 I've shelved this as a memoir or autobiography, but it is not a linear story as you would usually think of in those genres. As the subtitle says, these are stories from a South African childhood. They are told more around ideas/themes that ran through his life. Rather than following along chronologically, Noah follows one train of thought from his youngest years into his early adulthood and then moves on to another to do the same. The first time starting a new chapter with him returning to his younger years, caught me off guard for a second - perhaps because of listening to it - but it was the perfect way to tell the various stories. With this structure Noah was able to follow a line of thought and really make meaning of where it started and how it impacted his life. 
 This is one of the audio books that I now need to go and find a hard copy of because there are some places that I want to go back to find and reread! He really hits home on some profound things that he learned growing up in the conditions and in that time and place. I related to some of these things on a personal level. However, there were some that are applicable to much of what we see going on in our country right now. At the very beginning of the book he says, ""The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all.""

I was surprised by how organized and intentional and architected it all was. It wasn't just subjugation and hatred, it was very well thought-out subjugation and hatred. I can't imagine how Trevor Noah and his incredibly strong-willed and amazing mother lived through it, especially since he was born mixed race. Which meant he didn't belong anywhere and was technically illegal. 
 You'd think this would be a sad story but it's an incredibly uplifting story. Especially entering into dark times now, it's nice to see that even in the worse of times one can make the most of life. For Trevor and his family, it almost seems like they didn't know anything else, so of course they wouldn't spend much time moping about it. They just worked hard, found all the loopholes, and fought the system whenever and wherever they could. Did I mention, his mother is truly incredible? 
 The book is basically a memoir, but written in episodic chapters, each one telling a poignant or funny story about growing up. It's not entirely chronological, and it doesn't cover Trevor's rise as a comedian. I would love to read a sequel where he talks about that, especially what it's like to move to the US where he'd automatically be seen as an African American instead of a mixed race South African. 
 In story after story, Trevor uses humor to dissect the concept of race, to show that it is really just a social construct. I really enjoyed reading these stories, as they are very relatable and charming. I loved reading about the young Trevor as a chameleon kid, not really aware of the way the world works, but just trying to figure out a way to thrive in it in any way possible.","Sun Jan 15 15:55:28 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 17 07:08:13 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 -0800 2017",7,0,"False"

 Mr Noah shared these stories from his childhood which will astound and move the reader. His story is often horrific. The title sets the story from the beginning because Mr Noah was born to a Caucasian European man and a black African woman. During Apartheid. His birth was a crime. And his childhood was as terrible as you would expect. It was also far more wonderful than you would expect thanks in large part to a strong, funny, kind and loving mother. She is a force and she propelled him forward. His love for her is palpable in these stories. The reader goes away from it marveling at her spirit.

 This is a book full of laughs and full of feels. An amazing coming of age tale of currently the world's foremost comedian. Actually its less of his biography and more of a tribute to his mother and i guess that is the reason i liked this book so much. Trevor Noah is an amazing comedian, this book gives insight to where his comedy comes from, an almost absent father, an abusive drunkard step father, trying to find his identity as a mixed boy into a racially divided(White and Black) South Africa, being a crime under Apartheid and then an anomaly in the free South Africa, just him and his mother against the whole world, and finding comedy in every situation they ever found themselves in, no matter how absurd or bizarre or dangerous. 
 This is a splendid book and a testament of what a truly indomitable and a strong woman can do against all odds and in a world full of violence i.e raise a remarkable man like Trevor Noah.","Mon Dec 12 22:42:10 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 19 23:54:11 -0800 2016","Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 -0800 2016",4,0,""

 It's true that one of my favorite genres is memoir- I love finding out more (or in some cases anything since I'm not familiar with said person at all) about individuals & hearing stories- especially childhood ones. That being said, this mostly applies to people in the medical/music/historical/any background that doesn't automatically associate you as a household name. I'm not against celebrity stories in the slightest- I just find myself walking away being disappointed most of the time, feeling that it just barely skimmed the surface. I admit being a bit reluctant to try this- I knew who Trevor was, but I would not consider myself a massive fan in the slightest. I was nervous this would be another famous person talking about superficial things that I couldn't relate to. However, after seeing multiple glowing reviews & how this was supposedly about him growing up in Africa, I decided to give it a go. This anxiety completely dissolved within the first 10 minutes of speaking. 
 I immensely enjoyed hearing about the tight bond between Trevor & his mother, what it felt like always being an outsider, trying to figure out girls, dealing with his abusive stepfather, etc. All things I could connect to & FELT his connection to. (This cannot be said for everyone as some people will talk about their lives but you can still make out a distance from.) It was like he sat down & said ""Pull up a chair. I'd like to share with you my life."" All of this felt very authentic & honest. No B.S.; the way it should be. 
 Like I said, I'm not familiar with Noah's work. I know he's a comedian, but I was unaware of his technique. To just have this guy sit there, talking about his upbringing without TRYING to be funny & making me laugh (a lot)- that is very impressive. I am kicking myself for not paying attention to him sooner & looking forward to checking out his other works. But on the other end of the spectrum, this book wasn't all shits & giggles. As Trevor describes things such as: getting hidings, being in the midst of Abel's terror, being so poor his family had to eat caterpillars & suck bone marrow- he brings a lighthearted, optimistic tone to the table, but never so much that it overbears what these words truly mean. Basically he didn't treat the serious stuff like it was a joke, which I probably should have never thought would happen in the first place, but hey. You never know. 
 I don't really have a favorite story here, they're all great. Perhaps the Hitler one; that was both hilarious & enlightening. There were a lot of things I learned about African culture & liked that he took the time to explain these things. The only complaint I have is that there's inconsistency to the chronology here. He would go back & forth several times; it's not too much that it gets in the way, but it's definitely noticeable. He leaves the door open for another book & I would like to hear more stories about his career, if he chooses to do so. Overall highly recommended & if you have the option, choose the audiobook! Trevor's narration perfectly conveys the emotions invoked in the book, ones that I'm not sure would be felt with the same effect in text. This is absolutely a worthy memoir & I'm really glad I went with the GR community on this one. One of the best audiobooks I've heard in a long time.","Thu Dec 22 12:55:42 -0800 2016","Sat Oct 28 17:08:36 -0700 2017","Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 -0800 2017",25,0,""

His story gives you an inside view of growing up during apartheid, in which your very existence is a crime. His black mother chose to procreate with his white father on purpose, knowing that miscegenation was considered a criminal offense, their child would have to live a somewhat hidden life, and never having any idea that apartheid would end. (I believe that his mother is the key to this story. She is so brave, so funny, and so ridiculously stubborn that you can't help but wish you knew her personally.) His memoir is a treatise on the absurdity of race, racism, and the human condition. He talks about the various ways that different races are treated in South Africa, and as a result, how they see themselves, and how they behave toward each other. Along the way, you find out that Trevor was the naughtiest boy, and a somewhat heedless young adult. The book also details the misery of being left out as a child, the challenges of extreme poverty, and the horrors of domestic abuse. The book does not get into his comedy career, so perhaps that will be another book. I loved listening to this as an audiobook, which Trevor Noah narrates.

 Even though Trevor Noah grew up relatively poor in South Africa, it seems that the story of his youth isn't much different from growing up relatively poor in parts of the United States. What makes his youth so decisively different is that he had the strength to go on when it would have been much easier to surrender to his fate than find a better life. I mean can you imagine that when he was born, it was a crime for his black mother to marry his white father? Just his existence was cause for his mother to be unable to walk with him down the street. He didn't fit in with the whites, the blacks or even really the colored people since he was brought up to question authority. 
 Noah talks about his special treatment because of his white father but more importantly, how his mother fought to make him better. A lot of the stories that he tells make you reflect on how being poor and without education can doom a life. All of the stories are told with humor and a part of ""how did I survive"" type awe. I really enjoyed this and had no idea that his life was so full of horror since what he presents on television is completely different than his background. This is definitely a feel good book.","Tue Nov 01 15:33:09 -0700 2016","Mon Nov 14 16:39:51 -0800 2016","Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 01 00:00:00 -0700 2016",4,0,""

 - It gives a bare bones history of South Africa. Enough history is provided to give a context to the things that Noah was dealing with in his life. 
 - It explains the complexities of being mixed and never belonging anywhere you go. 
 - It talks about his mother's life and her choices from Noah's point of view as her son. But he goes beyond his own perspective and tries to imagine her point of view as well. I felt he showed his mother so much honor in this book. 
 - It talks about the emotional life of an abused family. For me, these portions were told with such truth and depth. 
 - It talks about the failings of the justice system towards women. ""They were men first, and police second."" This quote chilled me to the bones. 
 - It talks about labor and work that happens in poor communities. And how poor people's labor never leads to wealth. 
 - It talks about the role of faith in his mother's life. 
 That is the mind trip of this book. It's talking race, systematic oppression, apartheid, labor, education, policing, prisons, domestic violence, feminism, masculinity, family, childhood, adolescence, etc. And Noah is able to talk about all these things from the point of view of his lived experience with complete candor. And his writing style is one of those where it sounds so conversational, so casual, -- until you notice how intricately humor is woven with pathos, and how effortlessly historical fact is melded with emotion. His writing style is amazing. (And this book was a page turner. I read it in about three days.) 
 I left this book feeling educated about South Africa and also moved. Moved by Noah's mother-- her courage as a young woman and her consistency and strength as a mother. And also I was moved by Noah as a writer and as a son. I really respect Noah for the beautiful way in which he depicted his mother's life. 
 The only thing I wish was that there had been a trigger warning for domestic violence --I was not aware of that going into the book, and it was quite frightening to read.","Wed Aug 16 06:45:20 -0700 2017","Wed Aug 16 07:31:31 -0700 2017","Wed Aug 16 07:31:31 -0700 2017","",0,0,"False"

Unless you've already read this book, I'm guessing you don't know about his childhood growing up in South Africa. 
 Trevor was born to a black mother and a white father. In South Africa, a person of mixed race is called colored. Under apartheid, it was illegal for a black person to have sex with a white person. Having a colored child was concrete evidence that this had occurred. Thus, Trevor was ""born a crime."" 
 Born a Crime is not a chronological time line of Noah's childhood. Rather, it's organized of snippets related by themes such as going out in public with his white father, church with his ultra-Christian mother, school life and so-on. 
 I was constantly amazed at the events Noah recounted from his childhood - the extreme poverty, his abusive step-father, life during apartheid. Through all of this, his mother remained a steadfast source of unconditional love and support - the kind of mother who would literally take a bullet for her child. 
 Noah's memoir ends when his childhood ends and young adulthood begins. He briefly mentions that his traveling the world performing as a comedian but only because it was essential to understanding a story about him and his mother. He makes no mention of any details about why he chose comedy, how he got his start, nothing. Don't go into this expecting to get any scoop on his career. But here's the thing: Even if Trevor Noah wasn't famous, his memoir would still be extremely compelling as a glimpse into growing up as a colored person in South Africa. It's a miracle that he turned out to be as successful as he is with everything he went through growing up. I was thinking about him for days after I finished this book. 
 I listened to the audio version of this book which made me feel like I was having a conversation (albeit one sided) with him. I love his accent and the accents he did of all the people in his life. Hearing him speak in his mother's accent was delightful. I also liked knowing the correct pronunciation of all of the unfamiliar African words. 
 Born a Crime is one of the best memoirs I've ever read and I predict it will have a high spot on my best of picks for the year. I highly recommend it to all.","Thu Mar 02 18:18:46 -0800 2017","Mon Mar 13 21:52:02 -0700 2017","Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",0,0,""

As a big Daily Show fan who fell off when Trevor Noah took over, I wasn't sure if his humor would be up my alley. I was dead wrong. As I was reading this, I kept telling friends that The Daily Show isn't doing justice to his humor. This book was laugh out loud funny while never minimizing the bizarre and disturbing circumstances of growing up illegal in apartheid South Africa. 
 The book is an incredible tribute to his mother, who is portrayed as bossy, fearless and whip-smart. She's honestly inspiring in how little she cares for the social structures of apartheid that try and hold her back. The two of them are a united front against the ups and downs of life, which Noah writes about eloquently and hilariously. 
 Noah does an especially good job of introducing the structures of apartheid, the geography of his youth and the ups and downs of being someone who never fit in anywhere. Despite the serious nature of the topics, Noah is a world class comedian and makes even the darkest of stories hilarious. I definitely recommend picking this up and reading it, no matter who you are.

I love his comedy, particularly his home-grown variety. So it was interesting to read about his childhood growing up my home town, Johannesburg. He gave me a glimpse into a life very different to my own. As the child of a black mother and white father, Trevor was literally 'born a crime' in the Apartheid era, and even after the laws had changed, still struggled to fit in to a society delineated along racial lines. He describes himself as a chameleon, taking on the characteristics of each group he was with at the time in order to fit in. It helps me understand his remarkable gift for getting voices and mannerisms so spot on in his comedy. The book is not as funny as I would have expected, but a rather serious look into a life growing up in a divided society. Ultimately, it's also a tribute to his remarkable mother.","Mon Dec 26 00:28:10 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 26 00:44:24 -0800 2016","Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",1,0,""

Noah connects the dots between South African racism and US American racism, going straight to the point: race is a social construct, racism is illogical, racist systems steal choices and lives. But this is not a book of theories and definitions; it vividly illustrates those points by describing life for Noah in between the boundaries of color and race, left out of any one category and sometimes benefitting, usually losing out from this murky position.

Of course, some of the stories are hilarious (like the one about taking a dump on some newspaper in the kitchen while his blind great grandmother calls out trying to figure what's going on and what's that smell, all because he didn't want to go out in the rain to the outhouse. I was rolling). But the tone is conversational, so it just felt like I was hearing the story from a spectacularly funny friend. Noah offers a lot of insight into race, culture, and society in South Africa. The tales of his life thus far are well-crafted and really interesting. 
 This book is also very much an ode to Noah's mother. She features in nearly every story, offering him guidance and love (and also sometimes weird advice or tough love). It's a loving tribute to her.

It started to grate on my nerves by the end of the book, because it was so unnecessary, like a next, on TREVOR NOAH'S MEMOIR tagged on to a thematically different set of stories. 
 2. His stories about his friend Hitler are funny and thought-provoking, but I think it's disappointing that he doesn't give even a sentence over to discovering that Hitler's name was incredibly offensive to people in other parts of the world, or coming to understand why chanting ""Go, Hitler! Go, Hitler!"" would stop a dance show in a Jewish school. He writes with clarity on the reasons Hitler isn't history's greatest monster for peoples who suffered other atrocities. However, I think that including a line or two about the way his understanding of the Jewish school story changed over time would have kept the incisive point while showing a little more compassion all around. It also left the story feeling a little unfinished for me. He obviously understands now why things ended the way they did--so when did that happen? 
 Highly recommend the audiobook, perhaps to the exclusion of the printed editions. Trevor Noah's as good a reader as he is a news comedian (and a better interviewer than Jon Stewart was), and his way with languages is incredible. I listened to him move between accents and languages for eight hours, and I'm still impressed by it. 
 ALSO PLEASE BE WARNED: TWO CATS SUFFER EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT HARM IN THIS BOOK AND IT WAS UPSETTING. SPECIFICALLY, they're murdered in a violent, horrible way. It's not described gorily, but the description is clear enough that it's easy to picture what happened. It is not fun to picture what happened. I DIDN'T LIKE IT.","Thu Dec 15 18:47:00 -0800 2016","Tue Apr 18 07:01:14 -0700 2017","Tue Dec 20 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,1,"True"

 Born A Crime tells Trevor Noah's wickedly arduous journey growing up in South Africa as a colored child, half white and half black. He was by law, born a crime, and knew he could be taken from his parents or they could be jailed as well. I don't live under rock and I adore living in fiction, however, I must admit, I had NO IDEA who Trevor Noah was. I was repeatedly asked if I'd read this yet and after each no, I was told, ""Good, you must listen to it because of his excellent narration."" So I did. 
 First and foremost, I learned so much about apartheid that I didn't know before. I knew the basics, Mandela, the Dutch, the ANC, but this book taught me new information just from his storytelling. Isn't that the best way to learn? Add to that his humor, smarts and charm, and I just wanted to drive all day to hear more. 
 His antics seem to fit the bill that the truth is stranger than fiction. From being thrown from a car, having to attend black church, white church and then black and white mixed church on Sundays, pushing his mom's Volkswagen down the road, driving when he was 6, going to prom with the 'prettiest girl in the world' that wouldn't get out of the car are just a examples of his hardships and sometime humorous trials. On top of this, he was poor, hungry, acne ridden, had low self-esteem and was lonely for friends. 
 His mom was a woman to be reckoned with and I'm certain her life lessons which were often arbitrary and sometimes cruel, were instrumental in making Trevor who he is today. I adored their letter writing back and forth. Honed his writing skills and required thought during an argument! 
 This memoir is not just about The Daily Show host, Trevor Noah, but also about South Africa's tragic history being wrapped up inside him.

Trevor's mom was not having any of it. She was going to do her thing no matter what system of oppression was in place. She is really the most amazing part of this story. Of course Trevor gets some credit too. His mom a great influence, he also knew his father. During his teen years, he lived with a step-father and lost touch with his biological father.

 Warning: This book is for adults only & contains extreme violent or graphic adult content or profanity &/or sexually explicit scenarios. It may be offensive to some readers. 
 I did not receive any type of compensation for reading & reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers & authors, I am under no obligation to write a positive review. Only an honest one. 
 A very awesome book cover, great font & writing style. A very well written cultural memoir book. It was very easy for me to read/follow from start/finish & never a dull moment. There were no grammar/typo errors, nor any repetitive or out of line sequence sentences. Lots of exciting scenarios, with several twists/turns & a great set of unique characters to keep track of. This could also make another great cultural memoir movie, college PP presentation, or better yet a mini TV series. There is no doubt in my mind this is a very easy rating of 5 stars.

It is a great book if for nothing else than the first hand account of life under apartheid, especially for a colored boy (that is the term used by Noah and the government of South Africa to describe people who are neither all black nor all white.

Since Trevor Noah took over, very few clips have made their way to me, so I wonder how well the switch from Jon Stewart is going. I imagine it'll take some time for him to find his stride on there, and I do hope he's given the chance, because, from watching his stand-up and reading this book, it's clear he's the type of person that needs to be on American television right now. 
 Trevor Noah was born in South Africa during the apartheid. His father is a white Swiss man and his mother a black Xhosa woman, which is where the title comes in. It was illegal to have a child of mixed-race at the time, and the stories of him growing up with parents who were not allowed to be seen with him in public are heartbreaking, but he also manages to make them hilarious. This whole book is a testament to finding the humour in dire situations. 
 If you're Native American and you pray to the wolves, you're a savage. If you're African and you pray to your ancestors, you're a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that's just common sense. 
 One thing I really found interesting was how racial lines were handled during that time. There were, of course, black people and white people. Those of mixed race are classified as coloured in South Africa, which isn't the derogatory term that it is in North America. There are obviously racist attitudes towards those people, but the term itself apparently isn't treated as a slur. But just to drive home how ridiculous the classifications get, for convenience sake everyone was placed into one of these three categories. So Japanese people were labelled as white and Chinese as coloured, for example, and people could apply with the government to have their classification changed depending on their skin shade and economic standing. It really was idiotic, and I believe a lot of those attitudes still exist to a certain extent in the country. 
 This is his story of growing up poor in a country that didn't think he should exist. His father couldn't be seen with him, and his mother had to pretend he wasn't her son or risk him being taken away. He grew up with a violent and unpredictable drunk of a step-father and had a lot to struggle through, but he also grew up with an incredibly strong mother who clearly had a huge influence on him. It's not just his story that's interesting; it's his outlook and the lessons he learned from his family and his life experiences. This isn't a comedy book, it deals with some very dark subject matter, but it's written by someone who can't help but be funny. 
 I would highly recommend the audio book. Trevor Noah is a natural storyteller, his narration of this book is brilliant, and you also get the added bonus of listening to him speak phrases in Xhosa. That's the language with the clicks that you may have occasionally seen Robin Williams mimic, but it really is beautiful and mesmerizing to hear. 
 Nelson Mandela once said, 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.' He was so right. When you make the effort to speak someone else's language, even if it's just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, 'I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being. 
 Loved every minute of this. If you enjoy memoirs, I don't think you can go wrong with Born a Crime.

I was fairly young when Nelson Mandela was freed and I was so far removed from that side of the world that it meant little to me. It wasn't until I read J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace that I took it upon myself to learn something about South Africa and its turbulent history. I still feel woefully unequipped to comprehend, let alone discuss, the ramifications of apartheid, so it was with open, knowledge-hungry arms that I grabbed Born a Crime, Trevor Noah's memoir of growing up as a half-black, half-white citizen in South Africa during and after apartheid. 
 The title is literal: during apartheid, it was illegal for a black person to have sexual relations with a white person. As such, Noah was treated differently than the other children he grew up around. He was kept indoors, so that others wouldn't see a light-skinned child running about. When he went for walks with his mother, she walked behind him and a colored neighbor whose skin more closely resembled his. His grandmother wouldn't punish him like the others because his skin showed bruises, and his grandfather called him ""Mastah,"" though Noah didn't know what that meant at the age of five. 
 What is so interesting to me, as a fellow half-black person, is how different the mixing of races can be perceived depending on location and political environment. While I've certainly had to answer my fair share of ""What are you?"" questions, I've never felt the intense divide that plagues Noah throughout his life. I've had the luxury of refusing to choose a side, but Noah did not - at times it was literally a matter of life and death for him. Yet, owing to his dual ethnicity, he is privy to the machinations of a society that works to oppress those with darker skin. He can see how arbitrary these ethnic classifications are and how striving for whiteness only furthers animosity between these groups. I was gobsmacked by the idea that individuals could promoted to white: ""Your hair might become straight enough, your skin might become light enough, your accent might become polished enough - and you'd be reclassified as white. All you had to do was denounce your people, denounce your history, and leave your darker-skinned friends and family behind."" Although I am familiar with ""passing"" (that is, being light-skinned enough to pass for white), I am not aware of any such promotional system ever existing in the US. But in a way this still hits a bit of truth for me, for this is the plight of many mixed race people - society forces you to choose a side and deny a part of who you are. 
 For all of the brilliant edification Noah gives us on living in and after apartheid, rest assured that he also includes a fair bit of self-deprecating humor in these pages. His pawn-shop hustle is impressive, though ultimately self-defeating, and I've rarely felt so embarrassed for a person as I did when he talks of a major social blunder during his days as a DJ doing dance battles (I won't spoil it, but it's a good one). But even within the humor, Noah manages to excavate a lesson in humanity in every story. He is admittedly not smooth with the ladies in high school, and even though he managed to get the most beautiful girl he and his friends had ever seen to go to prom with him, he couldn't convince her to get out of the car because he never bothered to find out that they didn't speak the same language. It's a fitting metaphor for the environment in which he grew up. 
 This is a story about politics and social strife, but ultimately it is one about family. For all his bad behavior as a child, Noah is always in awe of his mother's strength, and never more so than when he talks about the period of their lives where they suffered at the hands of his abusive stepfather. The story he tells will chill you, and though it should not be surprising that a society still living in segregation would also work to subjugate its women, I could not help but be appalled by the events he chronicles. And then I was saddened, because I know that this continues to go on today and I know this is happening here, just as much as it is happening there, and we are still so far from finding a way to fix it. Noah isn't so bold as to suggest a cure for the patriarchy any more than he is to suggest a cure for systemic racial oppression, but in talking about his mother's abuse so openly, so plainly, he gives voice to those who cannot be heard. He is doing for others what his mother did for him: 
 My mom raised raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid--not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered... the highest rung of what's possible is far beyond the world you can see. My mother showed me what was possible. The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will. 
 Many of you already know Noah from his assumption to The Daily Show's throne and you may have already formed certain opinions of him. I encourage you put aside whatever feelings you have about his work to read this informative, heartbreaking, and inspiring book. 
 (Note: I was able to snag a free copy of the audio during an Audible promotion and listened to it while reading along. I highly recommend it, as Noah's voice adds to so much his own story. It was also great to hear his pronunciation of names and words I wouldn't even begin to know how to say.)

While telling a story about himself, Noah ultimately wrote a love letter to his mother, who became as much the center of the story as the author. It's hard to imagine being ""born a crime"" (or maybe not in the current political chaos and burgeoning xenophobia in this country). Having been born to a black mother and Swiss father, Noah was kept hidden for his early years for fear of being taken by the government. The majority of the book deals with him trying to figure out his place in society----with the black kids, white kids, Indian kids and so on. More often than not, as a child he finds that because of his lighter skin, he has trouble fitting in but finds ways to do so with humor and an ability to pick up many of the languages spoken by the different groups in South Africa. Along the way, though, the reader is introduced to his mother and her strong dedication to faith, her fierce independence and the fight she faced as a woman in a male dominated society---one in which it was considered okay to strike your wife without fear of legal action. (Spoiler: The step father even attempts to kill his mother and got 3 years probation and walks free today!) 
 The book is a charming, quick read and gives you a sense of how Trevor Noah ended up where he did. He's an intelligent, hardworking young man who was backed by a mother who shaped him that way. If you enjoy his late night talk show or just enjoy a good biography, you will not be disappointed.

Hearing those words in his own voice brought something special to the story and made me appreciate it so much more.

What was surprising was the variety and depth of the stories he had to tell. Noah grew up the son of a black mother and a white father, during and after Apartheid, and his experiences chronicle not only his own history, but that of the country, as both he and his nation try to untangle the changing race signifiers and relationships that form the core of South African identity. 
 While the historical context is certainly absorbing in itself, the memoir is at its best when Noah is taking his time to let a small tale unfold, like the one about his six-year-old self electing to shit on the floor of his one-room house, rather than face the cold and rainy walk to the outhouse, only to find himself the center of a circle of hysterical women convinced the turd was the work of an evil spirit. These anecdotes illuminate daily life in a general sense but also create the specific history of Trevor's own life trajectory, which is both informed by the cultural touchstones of his childhood and also unique to him, with his unusually strong-willed mother and movement among various class, race, ethnic, linguistic, social, and economic groups.","Wed Dec 07 03:25:10 -0800 2016","Thu Feb 16 07:18:57 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 16 07:18:57 -0800 2017","Fri Jan 20 05:07:35 -0800 2017",0,0,""

It's a society we Americans know almost nothing about viewing it as we do from the outside. 
 This book is the ultimate in showing how the political is personal. But the reason it's stayed so poplar is that it's a nostalgic, sweet and funny remembrance of his childhood and youth. Episodes are recounted that anyone can identify with. Then he shows you the twist- how the situation is actually quite awful due to institutionalized racism or cultural sexism or practiced colorism. This guy cannot escape the ramifications that come with the color of his skin no matter where he goes. It's absolutely CRAZY but every one goes along with it so he deals and hustles as best he can. 
 His personal reflections coupled with the history lessons he gives- with a full context so you can understand the devastation caused and how it underpins present inequities- well I like to be educated about what has really happened- don't you? - make this book truly unique. It's both a readable irreverent personal history and a cry of rage and bitterness at the loss of all that could've been and could be in the aftermath of Apartheid.

I have never been a fan of Trevor Noah's stand up work but this memoir of truly remarkable. The book shines a spot light into the horrible living conditions in South Africa during the Apartheid era. For those who don't know what Apartheid it's a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP), the governing party from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. What makes this book so good is that its full of facts of this dark era in South African history. He manages to bring humor and yet remain stern on his true feelings on how South Africa in itself has been a racial battle ground since the 1st and 2nd Boer war. 
 The book is full of quotes some funny and some sad but they leave the reader thinking. 
 ""Language, even more than color, defines who you are to people."" - Trevor Noah 
 This is a good example of one that stuck to me. Being a bi-lingual minority Trevor hit a nerve in me while reading this. I have shared those same thoughts and feelings of confusion while being judged for various difference. One of my favorite parts of the book is when Trevor speaks about selling mix-tapes and illegal pirating music to sell to locals. This same chapter speaks of his friend nicknamed ""Hitler"". Who in their defense, they had no idea of the genocide that Hitler was doing in Europe. They were never taught such history, rather in fact they were convinced that Hitler was just another powerful ""White man"" attempting to gain power. 
 If you read essays and books such as Africa's World War: Congo, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe. You'll understand that what happened to Jews during WWII has been on going issue in this Continent so to a South African Hitlers WAR was just another historical fact to memorized for a school exam and quickly erased and replaced with the new Western Hip Hop influence. 
 ""I was blessed with another trait I inherited from my mother, her ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the thing that caused the trauma, but I don't hold onto the trauma. I never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something new. If you think too much about the ass kicking your mom gave you or the ass kicking that life gave you, you'll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It's better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on. You'll have a few bruises and they'll remind you of what happened and that's ok. But after a while, the bruises fade and they fade for a reason.

 This is perhaps the most remarkable celebrity memoir I've ever read. I am a hyperbolic person by nature, but I'm really hard pressed to remember one that's made this big an impression on me. Not just because of the content--which is at times heartbreaking and mindblowing--but also because of the humor and warmth with which Trevor Noah's managed to convey some very difficult life experiences. 
 Born in South Africa in the mid '80s, Trevor Noah's very existence as a biracial child was illegal. Even though apartheid fell while he was still a child, he faced unique challenges due to his ill-defined racial identity. He stood out as light-skinned in the poverty stricken black neighborhoods, but that didn't mean that he was spared the poverty or the prejudice faced by anyone who wasn't white. 
 Noah introduces each of his stories with a little bit of background information on the political climate and culture of South Africa. Then he describes different phases of his life through that lens, looking at how his childhood friendships, early attempts at romance, and a sometimes turbulent family life: His mother remained single by choice until Noah was around 10, then she married a man with a violent temper and he lost touch with his birth father. 
 It's not all bleak, though. Some of the stories are just about the hi-jinks that a teenaged Noah got into with his friends. It should not surprise you to know that he was a bit of a troublemaker and a hustler in his youth. 
 But even when he's describing some unimaginable difficulties, Noah managed to make me laugh SO MUCH. His solution to his fear of using an outhouse shared by several other families in his grandmother's neighborhood? Ridiculous. The time that he didn't realize that his date to the school dance didn't speak the same language as him? Hilarious. His response to his mother throwing him out of a moving vehicle because she was afraid that the driver of the minibus was going to kill them? Shouldn't be funny, but it was. 
 But, the story that killed me was the one where he realized just how problematic his friend Hitler's name is. 
 This is the kind of book that knocked my worldview around a little bit. I always knew that, yes, life under apartheid was hard, but Noah showed me just how hard, in a very visceral and personal way. He also showed how the shadow of apartheid lingered long after Nelson Mandela walked free, something that's easy to forget. But what he really does so well here is demonstrate the power of human resilience. He gives so much credit to his mother, which seems to phenomenally deserved.

If we want to learn anything about how to handle our current political climate, we should listen to him. Growing up first under apartheid and then in the shadow cast by apartheid, the child of a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, he was seen as an outsider in every group in South Africa, but he found a way to relate on many occasions to every group on a personal level. His commentary on what a common language will do for understanding and building relationships is astounding. His sense of humor, his relationship with his mother, his perspective on life in South Africa are all highlighted in this book and it is endlessly fascinating. This book focused on his life before his success and I really hope he writes another book on how he started his stand-up career and became a success. He is so smart and so introspective.

It was only after reading that I checked and discovered the author was a comedian. Well, that should explain the humour aplenty in the book... 
 Born a Crime tells the story of a mixed boy growing up under South African Apartheid. Although littered with plenty of funny quips and rib cracking statements, Born a Crime does not fail to give a vivid overview of the racial system that so dominated the entire South African system. 
 The book is written from the POV of the author, who is the subject of the book. The writing is not static, neither is it progressive like normal prose. The prose jumps from different events and scenes, following a trend of linked themes, rather than chronicling events in a linear manner. 
 The story is an apartheid eye opener. The evils, intricacies, ironies and grim facts of the system are in stark contrast with the matter-of-factly manner in which it is delivered. The end result is a hilariously chilling expose into the unbelievably tough upbringing of a young boy of mixed heritage in South Africa. 
 As I commence my post-read mullings, I cannot help but wonder how it would have been for me, growing up in such circumstances. The ironic thing is that many Africans can draw parallels with Trevor Noah's upbringing, even if only in the slightest of ways. One begins to realise that the African experience is quite similar even in places as distant from the other as Nigeria and South Africa.

 Trevor Noah has taken a lot of heat for not ""getting"" the issues that face Black America. Not being a black American, I couldn't say whether or not that heat is justified, but I think it bears reminding that this man grew up a mixed race child in South Africa during apartheid. It's just possible that his perspective is valid. 
 In the final chapter, and I'm not marking this as a spoiler because it's also on his Wikipedia page so it's not like it's a twist ending, Noah describes the abusive marriage that led to his mother being shot in the head by her ex-husband. This whole episode is absolutely miraculous. The gun misfires several times when he holds it to her head and as she tries to get away and the bullet actually fires, it misses every major artery and vein and her brain and she spends only 4 days in the hospital. And yet Noah talks about the incident wondering why God allowed it to happen, rather than considering the miracles that saved her life. He acknowledges that he can't explain what happened, but treats it as a ""silly mom, thinking it was her prayers that saved her."" God is trying to get your attention, Trevor!

 Trevor Noah writes a very absorbing and straightforward memoir that talks about the atrocities of apartheid, what it was like to grow up feeling like you don't belong, and figuring out at a young age that the world is not confined to what you see around you. This could have very easily been a very solemn read but Noah infuses this light-hearted quality throughout all these stories that he recounts in his book. Even the very end when his mother is in the hospital, he and his mother are able to laugh at the horrible things that have happened to them. 
 On that note, Noah's mother is one of the strongest and most resilient people I've ever encountered. Her upbringing truly transformed Noah's perspective on life and you can very clearly see the influence she's had on his life.

In Born a Crime, Noah details his experience growing up in apartheid South Africa, where his parents - a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father - committed an illegal act just by conceiving him. Throughout this memoir, Noah shares many funny coming-of-age stories, ranging from his awkward first romantic encounters with girls as well as how he once set a neighbor's house on fire. While he maintains a jocular tone throughout the book, he also delves into more serious topics, such as the racism and discrimination he faced and witnessed as a child, the negative effects of colonialism on South Africa, and his mother's abusive second husband. This quote captures the concept of ""the black tax,"" and it features just one slice of how much Noah cherishes and commemorates his mother in Born a Crime: 
 ""So many black families spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past. That is the curse of being black and poor, and it is a curse that follows you from generation to generation. My mother calls it 'the black tax.' Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring everyone behind you back up to zero. Working for the family in Soweto, my mom had no more freedom than she'd had in Transkei, so she ran away. She ran all the way down to the train station and jumped on a train and disappeared into the city, determined to sleep in public restrooms and rely on the kindness of prostitutes until she could make her own way in the world."" 
 I only have a couple of criticisms of Born a Crime. Its structure felt a bit disorienting, as Noah jumps back and forth in time without any real reason for doing so. This jumbled chronology, while not super appealing, does leave room for another book by Noah, as he does not explore his comedic career in depth. His consistently cheerful tone also did not sit well with me at times. While Noah may just be a generally bubbly and optimistic person - which I respect a lot, considering the hardships he's overcome - there were chapters in which I wanted more introspection, more nuance, and more emotional vulnerability. For example, the last chapter that focused on his mother's abusive relationship moved me, but it felt odd that all of those events got squeezed into one sequence at the end, when they could have been woven in throughout the book. 
 Overall, a great memoir from an important voice in society today. Recommended to fans of Trevor Noah, to those who like coming-of-age stories, and to those who do not mind a lighter memoir with more humor than melancholy. Glad to see so many Goodreads folk getting into this one.","Mon Dec 19 20:39:30 -0800 2016","Thu Mar 09 14:28:26 -0800 2017","Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2017",31,0,"False"

I wasn't sure what to expect, because it is a comedian writing a memoir which can be hit or miss. But this one hits, and hits hard. It has its funny parts, many of them, but it's also just a really good example of a South African memoir and it's the first one I've read of a mixed person in South Africa, so I appreciate its existence on that factor alone. And would have read it even if it weren't written by a famous person. 
 So this was a good memoir because it had some good historical points (and will get a lot of Americans to learn something about South Africa) and from a very interesting perspective - someone who didn't really fit anywhere in South Africa. It also showcased his incredible mother, who defied any stereotype you could think of of an African woman. It had poignant parts, heartbreaking parts, funny parts, and brutally honest parts. All the best things that memoirs should have, especially when they are done well. And in this case, I think they were. 
 Really, the one thing that kept me from giving it five stars was the at times confusing linearity of the stories. A series of childhood stories don't need to be linear necessarily, but there were a number of stories that overlapped in time quite a bit and so I got confused a couple times, but also there were some pretty heavy events in his life that come up in some stories, but not others that happened at the same time and I would think some of those events would affect others in the same timeframe. So, the disjointed nature of some of it made me not give this a resounding review. 
 However, I still highly recommend it, even for people who aren't obsessed with South Africa the way I am. It's just a good childhood memoir.","Sat Apr 29 08:59:08 -0700 2017","Sat Apr 29 09:10:47 -0700 2017","Sat Apr 29 09:10:47 -0700 2017","",0,0,""

Thanks to the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 under the tyrannical apartheid laws, their union was illegal, which made Noah himself a crime. 
 His mother was a devoutly religious woman and Noah's stories of attending black church, white church, and mixed church all on the same day were guffaw-worthy. They were poor, but his mother was fearless, rebellious and determined to give Trevor a life of education, opportunity, and love. She was an indomitable spirit in his life and worked tirelessly to raise him to be a good man. 
 The stories aren't in linear order. They bounce around quite a bit, but this doesn't detract from the flow. Tales of first love, lack of friends, and not fitting in as a mixed race (""colored"") boy segue into years spent hustling pirated music, shoplifting liquor-filled chocolates, becoming a dj, and then a comedian. Noah is adept at weaving together his own personal history, some of which is unquestionably heartbreaking, with warmth, laugh-out-loud humor, and insight. He's a charmer and a master storyteller.

Along with many Americans, I was skeptical when Trevor Noah took over the reins of The Daily Show from Jon Stewart, an American treasure. I mean, who is this guy from South Africa and how the hell is he going to understand the nuances of our political system well enough to satirize it at the level of excellence to which we have become accustomed? Luckily, he has proved us all wrong (and I do not readily admit when I'm wrong) and made The Daily Show his own while maintaining the sincerity that we love. Then I stumbled upon his memoir and became an instant 100% true believer in Trevor Noah - skepticism shattered. 
 Listen to any of Trevor's stand-up, and you will most likely hear him use the phrase ""born a crime"". His birth was, literally, illegal. He was born during the last few years of apartheid, under which blacks and whites were not allowed to mingle, much less procreate. Trevor is a ""colored"" person - the term used in South Africa to describe individuals of mixed race. His mother is native South African of the Xhosa tribe, while his father is a white man from Switzerland. Imagine your mother and father having to pretend they don't know you (or each other) in public. That was Trevor Noah's reality for the formative years of his life. 
 The book is full of tales about growing up in a starkly segregated society, even after the fall of apartheid, descriptions of unbelievable poverty, language barriers, domestic abuse, and feelings of alienation from both races. By the way, Trevor can speak about 10 languages at various levels of fluency - makes you feel ridiculous for blowing off that college Spanish course, huh? What makes this book so enjoyable, and what I believe makes Trevor Noah a great Daily Show host, is his ability to understand and appreciate the myriad of cultural factors and intersections that underlie society's failures, flaws, and yes, successes, because he has witnessed so much of humanity's worst. In one of my favorite passages, he brings up the old adage ""give the man a fish, and he'll eat for a day; teach a man to fish, and he'll eat forever"" or something along those lines. He points out that it sure would help if you provided that man with a fishing pole. All the education in the world makes no difference if you don't have the proper tools to succeed. 
 Although it's Trevor's life laid out on the page, the true star and heroine of the book is Trevor's mom, Patricia. She is there in every story, usually at the forefront but other times as a background presence. Her unwavering love (usually of the tough variety) and support is evident, and Trevor never fails to give his mom the credit she deserves for guiding him in the right direction. She is a feminist in a patriarchal and segregated society refusing from the get-go to conform. The woman even survives a gunshot to the head, thereby cementing her membership in the bad-ass women society. 
 It's easy to write off celebrity memoirs as sensational self-affirming nonsense meant to amass more money and cement the author's fame. Many (if not most) of the books that fall into this category do fit the stereotype. This book is different, largely because Trevor's story is not the norm. It provides a brief look into a time and place of which most American's have very little knowledge. Along the way we are reminded that our Western-centric view of the world is skewed and narrow. I'm glad that the producers of The Daily Show took a chance on the kid from the other side of the world, and I'm especially glad that I took a chance on this book. I urge others to do the same - you won't be disappointed!

But it has a horrifying past and you cannot talk about South Africa without a discussion on apartheid which literally means 'separateness'. This separateness, as we all know, was based on race. But how many races were there? Colored, Blacks, Whites and occasionally Mixed (which was technically a crime). 
 Trevor Noah was a mixed child and per the law of land at that point in time, a crime. Hence the title. We all know Noah as this comedian who has taken over big shoes of Jon Stewart (and is doing a decent job of the same) but we do not know how he turned out to be who he is today. He has lived in shanty townships, conducted illegal businesses in hoods, DJed night parties, sold pirated CDs and spent a week in jail on carjacking charges. This book is a collection of all these stories which are actually grievous in nature but are narrated humorously, generating occasional laughs. I spent most of the book thinking how hideous a regime can be to subject an entire race through this for so many years and what rationale they must have in their minds for doing so. 
 Trevor's biggest influence is his mom and by the end of this book you will also end up respecting her, who made sure her son does not turn out to be a patriarchal black male she always despised and rebelled against. Her lessons for Trevor should be mandated upon all moms. Read this book for his mom, if for nothing else.","Mon Aug 29 00:15:35 -0700 2016","Tue May 23 23:08:18 -0700 2017","Tue May 23 22:49:20 -0700 2017","Mon May 22 21:19:32 -0700 2017",0,0,""

The reason I picked up this memoir was because I have friends who mostly get their news from his show (a fact, since its a comedy show, in and of it self raises flags for me), and because I saw a decent review of it in a magazine I trust. Their is nothing marvelous in his prose, but I think that only serves his narrative more. He's not looking for elegance or finesse, he's looking to show the truth and reality of racism in South Africa through the example of his life.

 I first got to know Trevor Noah through his stand up (https://youtu.be/GgZYCj39M38). He's come a long way, and I loved learning about his past. The vignettes in this book are honest, funny, and subtly but incredibly insightful. Here are some of my favorite parts: 
 - His navigation of an in-between identity: ""People are willing to accept you if they see you as an outsider trying to assimilate into their world. But when they see you as a fellow tribe member attempting to disavow the tribe, that is something they will never forgive."" 
 - His reflections on awkward teenage love: ""I don't regret anything I've ever done in life, any choice that I've made. But I'm consumed with regret for the things I didn't do."" 
 - His hilarious, oblivious promotions of Hitler. This segment matches the tone of his stand up and I laughed out loud. 
 - His empathetic description of the hood life--the hustlers, the different notions of right and wrong, the sense of community and escape from existential doubt, and the rigged justice system. The portrait of the misunderstood thug he met in jail was especially powerful. 
 - His love for his mom.

I'm new to this routine, new to The Daily Show, but leading up to the election and then its fucking horrible aftermath led me to shows, websites, twitter feeds, etc etc that I never paid much attention to before. The Daily Show is one of these. 
 With all due respect to Trevor Noah, I had no plans to ever read this. Celebrity memoirs don't usually interest me. The celebrity memoirs I would read don't exist because the people are dead. Or they're assholes or incredibly private. Or both. However, I was gifted this book. 
 Noah never mentions The Daily Show. He mentions his comedy career only when absolutely necessary. That part of his life is fairly recent. His first twenty years or so were spent either under South Africa's apartheid system or dealing with the aftermath of being a ""colored"" (the name given to people of mixed race) man navigating a post-apartheid environment. 
 Noah grew up in the Johannesburg area of South Africa during apartheid and was literally ""born a crime,"" as interracial relationships were punishable by law. He was a level of poor Americans cannot begin to comprehend. He was shut out from the world. ""Black people were not properly educated. White people didn't talk to black people. So why would black people know what's going on in the white man's world?"", Noah says on why no one knew who Hitler was. ""Black people knew of Hitler as a powerful person. A tough guy. If you want your son to be tough, you name him Hitler."" Noah knew more than one 'Hitler'. 
 Trevor Noah has a wisdom one can only get from growing up in apartheid South Africa. There were a few passages that were particularly memorable: 
 On the ""black tax"": 
 ""So many black families spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past. That is the curse of being black and poor, and it is a curse that follows you from generation to generation. My mother calls it ""the black tax."" Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use you skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to being everyone behind you back up to zero."" 
 On crime: 
 ""In the hood, even if you're not a hardcore criminal, crime is in your life in some way or another. There are degrees of it. It's everyone from the mom buying some food that fell off the back of a truck to feed her family, all the way up to the gangs selling military-grade weapons and hardware. The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn't do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn't discriminate.""

 He grew up as a mixed child in the apartheid, which punished interracial sex with up to five years of prison. He could only saw his father behind closed doors. He saw the regime change, the fighting on the streets. His mom is a strong, independent woman who raised him with tough discipline but also lots of love, humor and wisdom. Trevor is a smart and naughty child, and their relationship yields hilarious and touching moments. 
 Noah has many stories to tell, and he is a great storyteller and performer. There is never a dull moment. The stories are engrossing, educational, many have great lessons.

I'm not sure I buy his claim of not absorbing the trauma he experienced as a child who was born a crime but it was a insightful and heartwarming read.","Mon Jun 19 11:07:21 -0700 2017","Mon Jun 26 09:53:35 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 This was a very entertaining book. So entertaining that I suspect the truth may have been...um...tweaked a bit to maximize the entertainment value. I saw a documentary on Trevor Noah called You Laugh, But It's True, and in it a slightly different version of the story of his mother being shot is told - in the documentary it is presented as a random act of violence, and Noah does not say it was committed by his step dad. In this book the story is different - Noah is informed of the shooting immediately by his half-brother and it is clear who the shooter is. So why the two different versions? Is Noah using the story for different ends in the two tellings? There are other points in this book where I caught myself thinking that the stories just sounded enhanced...not ""false"", but certainly spun a great deal. A scene in which he is simultaneously so afraid that he thinks he may be about die, and also taking a nap. A hilariously funny scene at a Jewish centre seems more like a stand up routine than something that really happened - probably the truth is something much less entertaining than that story. 
 So three stars. Very entertaining, but I'm not so gullible as to confuse a stand-up act for reality.","Sat Apr 22 06:51:48 -0700 2017","Sat Apr 22 07:15:41 -0700 2017","Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",0,0,""

 Glorious. This book is absolutely glorious. I'm so in love right now, I can barely function. This memoir is unquestionable one of the most engaging books I've ever read, filled with such greatly vivid and riveting anecdotes, made more profound and unforgettable by the fact that they're true. 
 I don't watch The Daily Show, other than a few occasional clips on social media, and I never followed this guy before, so I decided to read this book solely because of the title. I love it. Born a Crime--it just feels meaningful. And, it is meaningful. I'm walking away from this experience knowing now that I love Trevor Noah. I love his writing and I love his wit. He is a fantastic storyteller who told of his childhood, one that was layered heavily with sadness, but for the majority of the time while reading his journey, I felt joyous. 
 This memoir is a compilation of notable anecdotes, mixed in with short passages of African history for context against the very special circumstances of Trevor's birth and childhood. Let me tell you, his childhood is better than any fiction and there are too many humorous and affecting moments to count. Some of my favorites include, the time when a criminal, young Trevor, who was being held prisoner in his Grandmother's house (for his own good), crawled through a hole under a fence to get to freedom. Then, there's the time when his first dog, Fufi, taught him his first lesson in love and betrayal. Or, the time when, after growing up on the kind of creative diet that only the very poor are weaned on, Trevor was left completely unimpressed with high cuisine meals such as bone marrow, which are no different or better than the dog bones he ate at home. For more funny and interesting stories, read this book! 
 Born a Crime begins before his birth, when his impetuous and wise mother convinced her kind, white neighbor to give her a baby, during a time when there were strictly enforced laws that prohibited intercourse between Natives and Europeans. The stories he describe span from that time to the end of Apartheid, and further to a time when blacks and coloreds were free to live the life they could wrangle from the system. 
 Trevor's--I'm calling him Trevor because I feel like I know him now. His thoughts on race and power are spot on and made more impressive because of his ability to use humor to show the illogical and ridiculous nature of the whole enterprise. Trevor is very smart, and a very adept communicator. There isn't a single part of this memoir that doesn't pierce you, wound you with truths, yet it soothes you with humor. I laughed because it was impossible not to. I laughed so hard that I cried, and then I cried because I had to cry. 
 Trevor grew up on a divided country, and the numerous poignant moments show clearly a boy caught between the many cultures of South Africa, which he navigated by becoming a chameleon, fitting in everywhere and nowhere at the same time. He adapted to each new situation as many entertainers do, by being whoever the people want them to be. That's not to say that Trevor is disingenuous in any way; no, he's observant, and his musings on life and relationships make it apparent that he has a damn good understanding of the human condition. 
 What is most lovely about his coming-of-age story is how Trevor speaks about his mother. His mom features largely in his story, and his love and respect for her is obvious, not only in his words, but in the actions he describes. Their bond is a tangible thing, and the most moving pockets of this book are the ones filled with his mom. 
 Honestly, this memoir is so brilliantly insightful that there are many many pages I marked, so many gems and memories I've saved to revisit again and again. I don't read a lot of biographies, preferring fiction to real life, but I'm insanely delighted that I strayed from my norm and read Born a Crime. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, sincerely, because it is truly glorious.

 I consider myself an unofficial expert on celebrity memoirs. I haven't read all of them (although I would like to - even the stupid ones, because I am incredibly nosy and devour celebrity gossip the way other people devour Dorritos or fake news), but I've read a fair amount, and they usually follow a typical narrative arc. In BORN A CRIME, Trevor Noah takes that arc, flattens it out, and beats you over the head with it. 
 I love Trevor Noah. I love what he brings to The Daily Show. I think he's incredibly funny, intellectual, erudite, and charming. I also think he's cute, but that's neither here nor there. I actually first learned about him through his (in)famous video with ""she who shall not be named"" (no, not Voldemort's sister - but close). I was really impressed by how he went about the interview. That could have been really ugly - but it wasn't; it was a somewhat civil discourse between two opposing views, about why the political beliefs of a certain demographic can be incredibly problematic. 
 When I found out that this Trevor Noah person, this cool political cucumber, had a memoir out, I immediately put myself on hold for it at the library. Unfortunately, so did about a billion other people. It took two freaking months for me to finally get my hands on BORN A CRIME. Normally, when I wait that long, I start to lose interest and by the time I get the book I sometimes forget why I even bothered to put it on hold in the first place. Not so, here. 
 Trevor Noah's memoir is not like other memoirs because he doesn't talk about his ""famous"" life at all. BORN A CRIME is about Trevor Noah's childhood growing up in South Africa while it was still under apartheid. He talks about slavery, segregation, racism, poverty, domestic violence and abuse, and all manner of other troubling topics, but he does it in a way that, while not exactly unpleasant, never becomes so graphic or unpleasant that I had to put the book down and take a deep breath. At times, he even manages to make the terrible situation he's describing funny, which is truly a testament to his amazing sense of humor. 
 There's a lot more I can say, but most of it would just be recaps from the memoir and more praise about Trevor himself. I really, really loved this book. It kind of reminds me of another memoir I read about a biracial man, THE COLOR OF WATER by James McBride, but I feel like BORN A CRIME is going to be a lot more accessible because a) he's a pop-cultural icon, b) Noah's book is broader in scope in terms of topics discussed, and c) he's a millennial so his language will resonate with a lot of people, especially the young bloggers, who are reading and reviewing this book. 
 Read this book. It was totally worth waiting for two months for.

 It's not. 
 I listened to the audiobook version, as was recommended, and I kept waiting - waiting for something spectacular to happen ... but I don't think it ever did. Some of what Noah says definitely makes you stop and think, lines such as ""the genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was,"" but he repeats his main themes ad nauseam. I don't know how many times I heard him say ""the genius of apartheid was ..."" again after this initial one - but it was many. You want to be like, okay, I get it - bad times. Many, many, many bad times. Such is growing up in apartheid - and immediately post-apartheid - South Africa. That's more or less assumed in the title. 
 My problem wasn't that, but that the book never really seems to delve deeper into these issues. ""Stories From a South African Childhood"" is exactly that - anecdotes, some more interesting than others, about a childhood that likely seems incredibly foreign and bleak to most who will read this. Perhaps, when recalling such childhood traumas, it's only natural to emotionally disconnect from the events at hand? Listening to Noah tell his story often feels like he's telling someone else's story. I'm also not sure why he's put them in the under he has. He'll tell a story about the search for his Swiss father as a young adult, and then the next story has him as a nine-year-old again. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for this, and these stories don't ever seem linked by any overarching theme. The story that closes the book doesn't give the closure that a story closing a book should, and leaves us with an awkward aftertaste ... is Noah suggesting, by ending with the story of his mother's near death, that divine intervention is actually responsible for her still being alive? I don't think so, yet the fact that he closes with lines that could have come straight from some Christian bestseller left me confused. 
 To be sure, some of these stories were amusing. The ""Hitler"" story was especially funny. But ""Born a Crime"" leaves us with more questions than it does answers. What is Noah's relationship with his father today? What happened to Abel? Certain stories are left feeling unfinished, and in a book with such potential, that really is a crime.","Tue May 30 10:41:17 -0700 2017","Sat Jun 10 11:24:45 -0700 2017","Sat Jun 10 13:07:56 -0700 2017","Tue May 30 10:41:18 -0700 2017",2,0,""

At times humorous and at times devastating, Noah brings his unique voice to this story. He writes like he speaks, and many times in this book it felt like I was hearing him narrate. I appreciated this book for how much information it conveys, and because it's told in a way that's understandable and sympathetic. Noah clearly isn't just trying to entertain; he wants us to understand his native country. 
 You may know him as the host of The Daily Show. Noah was born in South Africa in 1984, at a time when apartheid was in full force. Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990 and apartheid was abolished in 1991. As the title suggests, Noah was born from the illegal relationship of his black Xhosa mother, and his Swiss father. Children of mixed race were strictly illegal, yet his mother deliberately set out to conceive him. Noah's mother is really the star of this memoir, and clearly his strongest inspiration. She defies societal rules about what she can do, who she can talk to, and where she can live. But tragedy is ahead, as Noah tells us early on in the book that she will be shot by her abusive husband. 
 There are very dark moments in this book, but they are told in a matter-of-fact way that doesn't make light of the issues. Noah grows up in a time when the color of his face defines what he can do and how he is treated. By some black people he's treated with more deference, but white society sees him as evidence of a crime, which means for years he can't be seen in public with either his white father or his black mother. As he gets older, and after apartheid is abolished, he struggles to fit in with all racial groups. He grows up in a black family so he feels closer to them, but he isn't one of them. He learns over time to reach out to all three groups, and often it feels he's always playing a part, but he learns adaptability and that people of all races have something to offer. As an outsider, he sees the things that divide different groups of people, and he focuses on learning their languages so he can communicate with them. 
 If you're thinking this is the story of a serious, hard-working student who succeeds against all odds, you'd be wrong. Noah succeeds because of his strength, creativity and humor, but isn't always a nice kid, or a good student, or a law-abiding citizen. He isn't always nice to his mom. He spends most of his teen years learning how to bootleg music and sell pirated CDs. Oh, and he actually burns a house down. By not making himself out to be the perfect kid, you feel like he's telling you the truth. 
 Noah moves easily from telling us about the humiliation of his senior prom to describing a time he had to live out of a garage and sleep in cars. He endures great poverty and racism, but also encounters love, friendship, and inspiration. I was moved by his enduring relationship with his birth father, which is greatly restricted first by apartheid, and second by Noah's stepfather. 
 There are times the book is a little hard to follow, for the reason that it's written more thematically than chronologically, although he does move us from birth to childhood to young adulthood. Throughout the book I found I had to pay attention to where he is and how old he is, in order to put it all together, but that's not too much to ask of a reader. 
 This book gave me great insights into Noah's character and South Africa's history. He reminds us how little Western audiences (American audiences in particular) know about apartheid. It's clever, funny, informative, and emotional, and a book I highly recommend.

His shows are one of the enlighten ones focusing on race, white-privilege, police brutality, hate speech, prejudice, and so much more. 
 I'd highly recommend watching a few before reading this riveting memoir. 
 In Born a Crime, Trevor Noah takes us on a journey from his childhood being born a crime in apartheid South Africa. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. This memoir is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. 
 Side note: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - his mother - was a powerhouse, a strong woman in every sense. She's a warrior and I only wish I could be a half of the person she is. Also, I love the advice she gave her son--I even wrote a few pieces down to remember: 
 ""Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He's attracted to independent women. ""He's like an exotic bird collector,"" she said. ""He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."" 
 This passage had pretty much changed the way I think, the way I precept the world. 
 ""She'd tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by: ""If God is with me, who can be against me?"" She was never scared. Even when she should have been."" 
 The piece stuck with me. 
 Truly though, this memoir was enlighten, brimming with emotion, and I love it when children pay tribute to their hard-working mothers. 
 ""There was no stepfather in the picture yet, no baby brother crying in the night. It was me and her, alone. There was this sense of the two of us embarking on a grand adventure. She'd say things to me like, ""It's you and me against the world."" I understood even from an early age that we weren't just mother and son. We were a team."" 
 My mind and heart were fully transported while reading everything Trevor went through to get to where he is today and everyone that took part of that journey. 
 And even though some of the stories kind of broke my heart, Trevor Noah always managed to bring in his gold humor to ease the tension. There are a couple of chapters that have taken a hold of my soul and won't let go because either they were extremely hilarious (TREVOR, PRAY & LOOPHOLES) or entirely heart-shattering (MY MOTHER'S LIFE)... or both. 
 Slowly and surely, I came to admire Trevor Noah's character and honesty even more than I did before. And I'm pretty sure that I'll end up watching and rewatching his stand-up shows so that I can stop tearing up at the mention of his name.

 This is a story of Trevor's childhood- growing up in post apartheid South -and what an insightful memoir it is. You look at a person( celebrity) and based on how they look and speak you make a subconscious and harmless assumption of what their childhood must have been like. Then they write about themselves and you are forced to rethink all assumptions ever made. Ha, I shouldn't be making assumptions in the first place but we will deal with that human characteristic later. 
 I was laughing one chapter in. I however could not point out if the story was funny or if my reading it in Trevor's voice catalyzed the humor. I'll say its a bit of both. 
 The book is written the way Trevor speaks and specifically the way he delivers his jokes. The disadvantage being that a point will be put across by many redundant statements. Reading a paragraph of a bunch of sentences saying the same thing can be off putting. 
 The story is told in a non linear manner and that annoyed me as I had to start analyzing what age Trevor is and what events have and haven't happened when the chapter starts and progresses. It is however readable and for the simplicity it is narrated in, I easily shelved the annoyance. 
 My highlight was falling in love with Patricia Noah aka Mbuyi the minute she made him jump out of a bus and more so loved the relationship between mother and son. Learning more about South Africa's culture is a plus and the reason why I would recommend this book- the laugh out loud moments aside.","Wed Jun 14 22:29:35 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 28 02:14:59 -0700 2017","Sat Jun 24 12:01:29 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 14 22:29:36 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Jon Stewart, so closely identified with The Daily Show, made a bold choice in Noah - a young comedian of mixed race from South Africa and thus virtually unknown to Daily Show viewers. Over the ensuing year, Noah has found his footing and through his charm, humor, and intelligent ""reporting of the news,"" garnered his own following that is his alone without sacrificing the biting satire that is the hallmark of The Daily Show. In this book, Noah shares his life generously, and it becomes apparent where a lot of the qualities he displays before camera came from. 
 His Xhosa mother Patricia decided to have someone she could love unconditionally and who would love her back, and had to ask Robert, his Swiss father, several times before he agreed to fathering a child. A gutsy move since this was South Africa during apartheid, and Trevor's very existence was proof of a crime, his light skin could be cause for either parent to be imprisoned for up to five years. This book tells of Trevor Noah's early life, and he was a very spirited rascal of a kid -- but the lessons he learned from his mother were firmly rooted in tough love, providing him with resilience and strength. There are experiences I won't reveal since they would give away too much of the narrative, but only to say such events provide the impetus for the passion he shows on the Daily Show about violence against women in particular. 
 He alludes to his career as a comedian, but does not address how he arrived on Jon Stewart's radar and to his current status. That's fine. It means there's another book, some day, that we can look forward to.","Wed Oct 12 20:16:09 -0700 2016","Tue Nov 22 00:24:56 -0800 2016","Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 -0700 2016",8,0,""

I don't usually read memoirs/autobiographies, but having heard some of his life story before, I was interested. And I'm so glad I got to read this book. It was such an eye-opener for white people who I think often take their situation for granted. It gave me so much respect for the cultures in South Africa and what they endured, and continue to endure there, and it was a little daunting to read about Trevor's experiences as a mixed child who identified as black more often than white. The book carried his whit and humour (I could hear his voice every time I read a line), and he managed to bring a little light to certain dark situations in his past. For me, the highlight was reading about his mother. What an incredible woman, a force of nature who bowed to no one and gave everything for her children. This was such a joy to read, and it definitely brings to light how different some worlds are from each other. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, to be honest. This makes you think twice about the world and the role that race plays in it, and is a great tale of courage and love.

Being in South Africa whilst reading his book has truly changed my perspective on my current environment. 
 How he comes to claim his black identity is also intriguing to me. ""I didn't belong with the white kids...the black kids embraced me"". He straddles a strenuous line when explaining how he came to grasp with his cultural and racial identities. The way in which he describes his experience is also similar to the experience of black / african-americans in the states. From explaining only understanding the colonizers language to his mother disciplining him because ""if she doesn't, the police will"", there are several parallels to the South African experience. 
 The parallels of the history of coloured people vs. black people is portrayed in a statement in which he quotes, ""The history of coloured people in South Africa is, in this respect, worse than the history of black people in South Africa. For all the black people have suffered, they know who they are. Coloured people don't"". For some reason this statement deeply resonated with me and also helped materialize the cultural dissonance I felt as a black person in Africa.

Then I saw him perform live. Following which, a few weeks ago, I watched a documentary on his first solo stand-up show Daywalker in South Africa ... the documentary is called You Laugh, But It's True. I did not walk into this biography without any ideas about his life. 
 But this work illuminates more about his personal experiences as a half-black half-white kid growing up in South Africa during and after apartheid. It really doesn't detail the rise of his career. It focuses more on his relationship with his fearless mother, his relationship with the concept of race ("" ...and race is a social construct, so...""), and a large part is actually dedicated to South Africa's cultural, racial, and socialized gender relationships. 
 I think though that Noah's mother, Nombuyiselo, ""she who gives"" is actually the true subject of his book. His mother chose to bring him into the world, actively. She wanted a child. And as a result, his life was obviously shaped by this relationship between mother and son. She is definitely where he gets his sense of humor. After listening to Trevor tell his mother's story, about her life thus far, I deeply respect her. Even to the point where reconsidering religion and its power in people's lives became part and parcel of my thought processes throughout the book. At first, Noah talks about the three different churches his mother attended every Sunday ... and I was like, ""Jesus, I remember that"" in the sense that church as a kid for me was actually 3 times as long as mass as other people's churches (uggghh, what a waste of time). And his continually arguments with his mother about why Jesus would rather he rest and take medicine when he was sick on a Sunday than be healed at church were hilarious. His mother's belief and optimism is nothing short of impressive and something to be admired. I, in the meantime, will continue to be a heathen. But she has made me rethink my stance (which is always a interesting and good thing, in my own belief). 
 If you want to read this book, I would actually suggest that you listen to the audiobook. In his own voice and with his own emphasis with the many languages that Noah speaks, this book is indefinitely better.","Tue Jul 11 06:24:29 -0700 2017","Tue Jul 11 08:11:34 -0700 2017","Tue Jul 11 08:11:34 -0700 2017","Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 -0700 2017",1,0,"False"

 Who would want that particular challenge? 
 If you watched Trevor Noah early on and found yourself heading elsewhere for your political skewers and laughs, it may be time to check back. Trevor Noah has hit a groove. His humor is sharp. His ""news team"" (including Michelle Wolf, Roy Wood Jr., Lewis Black) are terrific. Plus, his interviews are smart. His passions and brainpower come through with his interviews. He is not afraid of a tough question. 
 Reading Born A Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood will make you wonder: how in the world did a guy with that upbringing end up in that chair every night on Comedy Central? Born A Crime doesn't cover that particular transition. The narrative only hints at Trevor Noah's leap to a national television stage. Most of this memoir is focused on his early days in South Africa, particularly the utter poverty in Soweto. Born A Crime is deeply personal. In turns, it is harrowing, funny, and wild. 
 The best stories involve Noah's status as half-black, half-white. Well, the stories seem to all revolve around his status (or non-status). Noah is the son a Xhosa mother and a Swiss-German father. Black. And white. Not white, not black, not from the complicated heritage known as coloured. Born A Crime is a story of survival--among authorities, on the streets, in church, among scrappy teenagers, in the dance clubs, and among the opposite sex. Noah's strong mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, dominates Trevor's world. She's the woman with a three-church Sunday routine. She's fearless, exacting, and determined. 
 Frequently, Noah leans on his multilingual skills to overcome tight social and personal situations, particularly one harrowing moment in prison. Noah knows Zulu, Tswana, Tsonga, English (and more) and shows the power of language and its ability to soften potentially tricky situations. Noah grew up as an eternal outsider with his light skin in a sprawling black township of Soweto. That outsider status forced him to make tough social and personal decisions over and over again. 
 As a teenager, Noah built a business copying and selling pirated CD's and then transitioned into a wildly popular D.J., throwing massive dance parties in a nearby shantytown called Alexandria. (The ""Go Hitler"" chapter offers a compelling reminder that the title of World Despot Ever goes to different people depending on where you live.) 
 Noah lived with death all around and, ultimately, violence comes home in the final gripping scenes as Noah's drunken stepfather turns on Noah's beloved mother with a gun. Riveting. 
 The book is as much about Noah's mother as it is about Trevor. It's clear that his mother wanted Trevor to set his sights on a distant horizon--and also wanted him to make good choices (even as he spent his formative years making poor ones, stealing candy or learning how to hustle stolen goods). 
 I listened to Trevor's narration on Audible. He is a very good storyteller. He knows how to set the scene and build dramatic tension over and over again. He's also a sharp observer. Of people, class, race, authority, religion. 
 And himself. He's also, it seems, fearless. No wonder he felt like he could step into Jon Stewart's shoes.","Sun Jan 22 10:46:21 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 22 10:46:53 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",2,0,""

 _____________________________________________________________ 
 This book was something I'd been looking forward to reading for quite a while now. Ever since I watched that first Trevor Noah comedy special on Netflix, and then the next, and the one after that, I've been interesting in the life he lived in South Africa. 
 Hearing about what people in South Africa went through, for the first time in my life, was a real eye opener. It's shocking to me that it's not something we hear much about, other than the stories of Nelson Mandela. 
 This book was so incredibly honest, and at times heart-wrenching. The strength of Trevor's mother is something to aspire towards, as well as her incredible determination to make her own decisions and live her life the way she wants to. 
 Trevor has only cemented my love for all he does through this book, and I look forward to following his career in the future.","Sun Mar 12 01:19:50 -0800 2017","Wed Jun 14 15:16:03 -0700 2017","Sun Mar 12 01:25:18 -0800 2017","Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 The book itself covers his childhood/teens in South Africa. There are pieces of perspective, insight and wisdom interspersed with stories about his life, his mother, his stepfather and brother and his experience as a mixed race (""colored"") child during Apartheid. Note: If you don't know much about Apartheid, this is a good introduction.

 I love his thoughts on language and belonging. The historical information about growing up in apartheid and its aftermath was fascinating. His mother also sounds like a very strong, very determined woman. There was a lot of humor to be found, as well as darker moments. I read the book, but I'd also like to listen to it on audio because I understand he reads the text himself and I think that would add to the stories he tells.

 Book description: 
 The compelling, inspiring, and comically sublime story of one man's coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed 
 Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. 
 Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother--his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. 
 The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother's unconventional, unconditional love.","Sat Dec 03 12:36:53 -0800 2016","Sat Dec 03 12:43:12 -0800 2016","Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",1,0,""

I think his comedy can be hit-or-miss, and I think his views of American politics are naive. But, the story of his childhood is a fascinating one. Namely because Noah, the ""colored"" child of a black South African and a white Swiss, was a bad-ass child. 
 He ran his mother ragged. He set fire to a house. He committed petty crime. But, when you hear him tell his own story, you can't help but root for him. 
 The book does exactly what is written on the tin. It's a book about his childhood. If you're looking for a memoir about his career or his stint on the The Daily Show, you're gonna be disappointed. It's also clearly written for a non-South African audience; Noah does a great job at explaining the insidiousness of apartheid and systematic racism. 
 For the most part, this book is a pretty light-hearted collection of humorous anecdotes about school, friendship, teenage romances, parties and drinking. I recommend it, though, for the final chapter in which Noah recounts life with his abusive stepfather. The way he describes the household is spot on and I wished he'd been able to expand on this part of his life.","Thu Nov 17 08:46:51 -0800 2016","Fri Jan 27 10:58:59 -0800 2017","Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 -0800 2016",0,0,"False"

 It's interesting to read his story because he is not bitter (he has a right to be.) He doesn't write out of anger (he would be justified in doing so.) He makes these insights into his past, into institutional racism, into apartheid that just force you to stop and think.

 As a child, I didn't compute the gravitas of that potential situation, and I certainly didn't consider what it'd mean for me as a mixed (or ""coloured"") person if I went there. And it never really has, not until I read Trevor Noah's startlingly insightful autobiography of growing up during apartheid. 
 There's racism, and then there's a racism that is so ingrained and systematic and institutionalized that it skewers and perpetuates everything about a person's existence, down to where they live, who they can live with, and the way they think about themselves, and that's exactly what apartheid looked it. The extent of which this ideology was driven into people's heads is disturbing as it is fascinating of how deeply entrenched an entire can be run based on the most arbitrary and ever-changing social constructs in existence. It was an evil so deeply rooted it's a wonder they ever managed to untangle it. 
 But this isn't a depressing or dark book, because Noah's humour, his wit and worldview is just as uplifting and full of energy as his stand-up comedy is. There's some genuine laugh-out loud moments in here, and his mother is the sort of person you wish you could meet in real life. Noah never gets didactic, he tells his childhood the way he lived it and it's an absolute blast to sit through. There isn't a dull moment in this rich and multi-layered narrative. If you didn't already like Trevor Noah and admire his work, you'll do so even more after this.","Sat Jul 15 16:25:38 -0700 2017","Fri Jul 21 06:53:13 -0700 2017","Sun Jul 16 21:51:02 -0700 2017","Tue May 16 00:00:00 -0700 2017",2,0,""

 For me I think the book worked better not knowing much about the writer, so I came to it with fresh eyes, and totally unbiased. It is a well written, well constructed memoir that uses some twists and plot devices usually found in fiction to tell his story, and tell it effectively. Trevor was born in a tumultuous time and place and survived some rather trying times and speaks about them elegantly and makes it possible to instill some empathy in the reader for an experience that one could not possibly know about, that is the power of the writing in this book.

When I found out the meaning of the title, that he was literally born a crime in South Africa under apartheid because his mother is black and his father is white, I knew I had to read it. 
 It was illegal to be ""colored"", the term used in SA for a person of mixed race. His very existence was a crime. His mother often pretended to be his maid so she could take him out in public. Noah tells us how he navigated extreme poverty and a social system where he never fit in anywhere, even after apartheid ended. But he was quite the enterprising, mischievous boy, which makes for much of the humor in the book. 
 What makes this book shine though is Noah himself narrates the audiobook. He's funny, intelligent and charming. He can make even a horrific situation funny. The tales of poverty, domestic abuse, and racism is sad yet Noah's comedic talents in telling the story blunts some of the horrors (at least until a particularly horrific event near the end). 
 How a boy raised in these difficult circumstances rises to become the replacement for Jon Stewart on the Daily Show is nothing short of amazing and is a testament to his resilience, grit, and the blessing of a loving yet tough mother. Yet Noah doesn't speak about his rise to fame, or his role on The Daily Show. His reason for writing was not to puff himself up, and regale us with tales on his road to fame. The reader leaves educated and more aware of the effects of poverty, abuse, racism, and how a political system like apartheid affects those who live under it. 
 I was both entertained and educated. It doesn't get better than that. Highly recommended, especially the audiobook - to hear Noah tell his story in his own words, with comedic timing, and the inflections and accents used for different people, is priceless.","Tue Jun 20 19:53:24 -0700 2017","Tue Jul 04 20:44:13 -0700 2017","Mon Jul 03 12:51:55 -0700 2017","Tue Jun 20 19:53:25 -0700 2017",12,9,"False"

 More importantly, it prompted me to re-examine my understanding of poverty, crime, and the relationship between the two. A few years ago I was fortunate to travel to Nicaragua, to a beautiful resort...located just outside the poorest area I've ever seen. It was a life-changing realization.

 The book only in the very briefest terms touches on his later career as a comedian (but not at all on his host gig at the Daily Show), it is an honest account of his upbringing in South Africa, at first under Apartheid, and later a country conflicted and confused in its aftermath. 
 The book comments on the confusing political, racial, and tribal undercurrents through Noah's experiences while growing up, going to school and a young man growing up. 
 He accounts for the situation of being a son of a black mother and white father, being the stepson of an alcoholic, abusive man that the police wouldn't hold accountable for his actions and his god-adoring, very religious mother. 
 This book gives us a fantastic view of what Noah's upbringing was like and what shaped him into the man and comedian he is today. 
 While I have always enjoyed his brand of humor, this book has further endeared him to me. I highly recommend this book, not just as an autobiography of comedian, because it isn't particularly funny, but deliver a picture of what life is like for less-privileged in South Africa.","Fri Jan 27 23:30:00 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 30 10:08:19 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

Hearing Trevor Noah tell his story made the book much more enjoyable for me. Especially because language factors so much into the telling. Since Noah speaks so many languages, I got to hear the actual sounds, something I would not have gotten had I read it. Trevor's story is an incredible one. Born under apartheid and growing up in the aftermath of its dissolution, Trevor tells a story that many of us in America know nothing about. He is insightful and sharp with his analysis of the conditions of his country, and is not afraid to represent his reality in all of its love, wonder, fear and difficulty. I also really loved the fact that most of his story centers around the relationship with his mother. Parts of this book were hilarious, like his stories about his dance crew being kicked out of a Jewish school because one of the dancers was named Hitler by his mother. Other parts were hard to listen to, like the stories of growing up with his abusive step-father. The only thing that I wasn't a big fan of was the way the story was structured. I liked that he didn't keep things strictly chronological, since many of the stories were thematically related, however, sometimes the jumps and transitions were hard to follow. Otherwise, loved this book.","Tue Jan 17 10:30:19 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 17 10:38:29 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

I don't know why I didn't have higher expectations, but wherever my expectations were (and I don't think they were that low), this book totally exceeded them. 
 Noah writes this in a very natural, talkative tone, which at times I found slightly irritating, crass, or rude (some swearing seemed unnecessary, not to mention the slanginess - I think this book would have still been highly readable without it), but for the most part I think it worked. It made me feel closer to the writer and the story. 
 I particularly loved the early parts of the book, which had a lot of information on the linguistic diversity of South Africa, plenty of dialogue written out it a non-English language (and then translated in the narrative) and early adventures and misadventures experiences by Noah in the realm of language. The earliest pages also had a lot of casual background information on Apartheid and South African politics - no way near enough to make me think I knew anything, but enough to pique my curiosity, and understand the various situations presented in the book. 
 Parts of the book were just very funny. The main body of the book is just full of anecdotes and stories from Noah's childhood and young adulthood, and great fun to read about. 
 Noah did an interesting thing with the organization of the book: he talked about the world he was born into, and his specific situation, with some seriousness. Then he got into the generally funny part. He told the rest of the story of his life through his early twenties in chronological order. And then, once he was caught up, he went back to the beginning to tell the story of his abusive stepfather, going back to his younger years when the stepdad first showed up, and told that story with a level of gravity that had not been present throughout most of the book. I wasn't sure what I thought of this tactic, but in retrospect I think it worked out all right. As a comedian it seems Noah wanted to tell his story a certain way, and by using this structure he was able to do that, and still managed not to leave anything out. It is slightly awkward, but pretty effective.","Tue Feb 07 11:24:30 -0800 2017","Thu Mar 02 15:05:01 -0800 2017","Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

I have been a Trevor Noah fan since my sister told me about him a few years ago and I watched one of his specials on Netflix. Then for my 1 year anniversary with my now husband, we saw him live and he was even better than on TV. When I found out he had written a book, I couldn't wait to read it and I am so glad that I did. It was enlightening, insightful, funny and very honest. I loved hearing about his relationship with his mother, how he came to know his father, learning more about apartheid and how that affected him as a mixed child growing up in South Africa and how he came to be where he is today. I actually listened to it as an audiobook, which I really enjoyed because he has such a soothing voice and he is great at doing variations and inflections on his voice to make it sound younger, older or pretty much anything.

I almost burst a blood vessel trying not to laugh out loud in my office listening to the poop in the kitchen story as he did her voice trying to figure out what was happening (it was dark and she was half blind with cataracts) and him, this little boy, pooping on newspaper because he was too frightened to go to the outhouse at night, in the rain.

With a black mother and white father, Noah never really fit into any one community, and was often labeled differently than he identified. His stories are funny and light-hearted at times, but also meaningful as he intelligently describes his observations of race, culture, language, belonging, family structure, domestic violence, crime, and implications of racism and sexism in modern society. 
 I really enjoyed his perspectives on language. He himself speaks many languages including English, Afrikaans, and Native tribal languages of South Africa, and he explains that by speaking another person's language we recognize that person as an individual and we make an attempt to respect him. I also realized how little I understood about life under apartheid and the hatred, ostracism, discrimination, and misunderstanding that still exist in modern times. 
 The essays seems somewhat out of order at times, and I would have liked to learn more about Noah's life after leaving South Africa and how he adapted to American culture, but overall I rated this book as 5 stars for his intelligent observations and entertaining stories.","Wed Jan 04 17:01:12 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 16 16:27:38 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 Trevor Noah weaves political and personal history in this story about his upbringing in Johannesburg, South Africa. His narration is passionate and nuanced that include the many real life characters whose voices he has developed through his stand up. Noah can speak a handful Southern African languages and he often includes whole lines of dialogue in Xhosa or Zulu for example. Though, my Zim born husband finds his vocal character work not as interesting as my unaccustomed ear. I maintain for the moment that Trevor Noah is a VERY handsome man reading VERY handsomely. :) 
 This would make a good primer for anyone wanting to learn more about the realities of post apartheid life or race in a post colonial state. With caveats for language, I think this would also make a a very engaging upper highschool read (and probably came out too late in the year to get on the Alex Awards radar?) This is clearly written for an American market unfamiliar with South African culture and history and I thought did the job of explaining terms and concepts in a way that was respectful to both audience and subject manner. 
 Wished there was more about the beginning of his job in comedy; didn't get explained or explored at all.

I am sure he will put out plenty of funny books later in his career.","Mon Jan 30 09:03:12 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 30 09:05:42 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

Trevor did a great job of narrating a very emotional growing up period with humor. Race or racism is an ugle spectre but in South Africa, the fact that he existed was a crime. 
 A very well written book that holds a lot of life lessons for anyone who can recognize the struggle of coming from a poor background. His background surely has prepared him for the roles he currently fills now. He now has the ability to relate to people from different backgrounds and his language skills definitely set him apart from many that have blazed a similar trail. 
 Being an only child gave him a strong imagination and a knack for being very observant that has served him well in his career. 
 I am a fan of his balanced philosophical approach to the turmoil in his family life. 
 A must read for any one who wants an insight into Apartheid era South Africa from a black African perspective.

 ""The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all."" 
 ""The Zulu went to war with the white man. The Xhosa played chess with the white man. For a long time neither was particularly successful, and each blamed the other for a problem neither had created. Bitterness festered. For decades those feelings were held in check by a common enemy. Then apartheid fell, Mandela walked free, and black South Africa went to war with itself."" 
 ""Like indigenous peoples around the world, black South Africans adopted the religion of our colonizers. By ""adopt"" I mean it was forced on us. The white man was quite stern with the native. 'You need to pray to Jesus,' he said. ""Jesus will save you.' To which the native replied, 'Well, we do need to be saved--saved from you, but that's beside the point. So let's give this Jesus thing a shot.' "" 
 ""For a long time I didn't understand why so many black people had abandoned their indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you're Native American and you pray to the wolves, you're a savage. If you're African and you pray to your ancestors, you're a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that's just common sense."" 
 Noah's book is part autobiography, part South African history, and part social and political commentary, wrapped up in just enough wit and comedic structure and timing to make it flow smoothly and swiftly, until all of a sudden you're brought up short with a 'wtf?' feeling as you realise the full meaning of what you've just read. 
 I've had a lot of respect for Noah's presence on TV as a successor to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. I now also have a lot of respect for him as an author - and as a man who lived through South Africa's troubled post-apartheid times and saw truths so clearly. 
 His account of his childhood, growing up as a child of mixed race, is lightly told, but horrifying. Under the segregation laws of South Africa, it was illegal for white people to have sex with non-white people; as a child of such a union, Noah was, as the title of the book says, 'born a crime.' His parents were not married - that would have been impossible - nor did they live together. Though his mother lived - quietly, secretly, illegally - in Johannesburg near his father's apartment, Noah could only spend time with his father in private. 
 ""Where most children are proof of their parents' love, I was the proof of their criminality. The only time I could be with my father was indoors. If we left the house, he'd have to walk across the street from us. My mom and I used to go to Joubert Park all the time. It's the Central Park of Johannesburg--beautiful gardens, a zoo, a giant chessboard with human-sized pieces that people would play. My mother tells me that once, when I was a toddler, my dad tried to go with us. We were in the park, he was walking a good bit away from us, and I ran after him, screaming, ""Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!"" People started looking. He panicked and ran away. I thought it was a game and kept chasing him."" 
 But it wasn't just his father who could not acknowledge him publicly. His mother, a dark-skinned Xhosa woman, could not be seen with a 'coloured' - the South African classification for person of mixed race - child without everyone knowing she had committed the crime of sleeping with a white man. 
 ""It was illegal to be mixed (to have a black parent and a white parent), but it was not illegal to be colored (to have two parents who were both colored). So my mom moved me around the world as a colored child. She found a creche in a colored area where she could leave me while she was at work. There was a colored woman named Queen who lived in our block of flats. When we wanted to go out to the park, my mom would invite her to go with us. Queen would walk next to me and act like she was my mother, and my mother would walk a few steps behind, like she was the maid working for the colored woman. I've got dozens of pictures of me walking with this woman who looks like me but who isn't my mother. And the black woman standing behind us who looks like she's photobombing the picture, that's my mom. When we didn't have a colored woman to walk with us, my mom would risk walking me on her own. She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn't hers, like I was a bag of weed."" 
 It was just as much a problem when his mother took him to visit his black relatives in Soweto. A coloured child in a black township was just as much a threat to his family as a coloured child in a white city. 
 ""My gran still tells the story of when I was three years old and, fed up with being a prisoner, I dug a hole under the gate in the driveway, wriggled through, and ran off. Everyone panicked. A search party went out and tracked me down. I had no idea how much danger I was putting everyone in. The family could have been deported, my gran could have been arrested, my mom might have gone to prison, and I probably would have been packed off to a home for colored kids. So I was kept inside."" 
 Noah's memories of his childhood make one thing perfectly clear - that he attributes much of his own character to his mother's independence and choices to live as far as she could outside the legal and social limitations imposed by South African apartheid. 
 ""My mom raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid--not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered. 
 We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited. Growing up in Soweto, our dream was to put another room on our house. Maybe have a driveway. Maybe, someday, a cast-iron gate at the end of the driveway. Because that is all we knew. But the highest rung of what's possible is far beyond the world you can see. My mother showed me what was possible. The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will."" 
 Noah completed the book prior to his becoming an American TV host, and the book itself contains very little about his professional life, or how he made the transition from a teenaged boy hustling pirated CDs to get by, to a well-known and admired comedian and TV personality. Perhaps that's for another book. 
 This one is the narrative of a mixed race child growing up in one of the most oppressive and racist societies in the world, and surviving. And it's well worth reading.","Fri Aug 18 00:54:33 -0700 2017","Fri Aug 18 00:56:04 -0700 2017","Fri Aug 18 00:56:04 -0700 2017","Fri Aug 18 00:55:11 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 white Swiss father and a black mother from the Xhosa tribe, there starts his story where he was already born a crime, since during apartheid, one of the worst crimes you could commit was having sexual relations with a person of another race. Therefore, his parents committed that crime. 
 Trevor couldn't even go out to play with other kids, or even his own cousins. Children could be taken. Children were taken. The wrong color kid in the wrong color area, and the government could come in, strip your parents of custody, haul you off to an orphanage. 
 His mother was religious, and Trevor was questioning religion. ""Look, Mom. I know you love Jesus, but maybe next week you could ask him to meet us at our house. Because this really wasn't a fun night."" 
 The rules about communion at Friday mass, for example, made absolutely no sense. We'd be in there for an hour of kneeling, standing, sitting, kneeling, standing, sitting, kneeling, standing, sitting, and by the end of it I'd be starving, but I was never allowed to take communion, because I wasn't Catholic. The other kids could eat Jesus's body and drink Jesus's blood, but I couldn't. And Jesus's blood was grape juice. I loved grape juice. Grape juice and crackers--what more could a kid want? And they wouldn't let me have any. I'd argue with the nuns and the priest all the time. 
 Trevor was an entrepreneur (but not of the very legal kind). He got to the hood, and started making money selling pirate music, and then becoming a professional hustler. But he ended up using his life experience to his advantage. An extraordinary man with an extraordinary story. 
 Surviving poverty, crime, religious upbringing, domestic abuse, and so many tough conditions (eating Mopane worms for example). Just a few examples of what's inside. One story includes his mom throwing him out of a driving minibus. Another of how his mother was shot in the head.

 Reading Trevor Noah's young life through his ear view mirror gives remarkably wide view of history, apartheid, social constructs, and philosophy without a grain of sugar-coating. 
 There are sections of this book I would read aloud to younger audiences (middle school) to share powerful messages from a pop icon- without an ounce of preaching. 
 I've already recommended this to a half dozen people, and will continue to do so. 
 Includes street language and harsh situations, but none are excessive or gratuitous.","Sun Jan 29 17:26:20 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 29 17:36:10 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",0,0,""

And sometimes I'd get celebrity's books because they are funny and also fun to read. Other than personal stories and anecdotes I never am really none the wiser after reading them. Kinda like watching a funny rom com. But this is not that. 
 I only learned of Trevor Noah when he took the reign over from Jon Stewart. There was a moment in time I was like, this is the worst thing ever! Jon Stewart is the best! But Trevor Noah has been doing a good job and has earned my viewership so far. So when his book came out, I was like hmm this might be interesting, like Tina Fey's or Amy Schumer's book, which both were very enjoyable. Talking mostly about their personal story and how they got to where they are.. But this is not that. 
 This is about South Africa, about apartheid, about women in Africa. I never thought I'd learned so much about African history from a book by a comedian. Yes he wrote largely about his childhood and his early adult life. But his was also the life of a colored child, navigating the complexities of school and family at the time of apartheid. The book was insightful in a way that it shows what life was during and right after apartheid, how white, color and black people were segregated through time, the relationship morphing as apartheid ended. And it was moving. By writing his own story, I got a rare glimpse of who Trevor Noah really is, and respect him so much more because of it. And I cannot end the review by saying how awesome his mother is. She is a jewel of this book and of this world.","Mon Nov 28 20:14:25 -0800 2016","Fri Dec 02 22:32:36 -0800 2016","Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

Noah's autobiography is honest, funny, sad, gripping and full of energy. It is really a coming of age and depicts Noah's trials and tribulations as a child born from a white father and a black mother in a racially abusive regime under apartheid. His positive upbeat character and that of his mum's helped him through thick and thin and determines his life today as a comedian, presenter and writer with race at the forefront of his internal monologue and of his dialogue with his global audiences. I particularly appreciated this life experience as it lays bare the extremes to which the regime went to divide and conquer the different racial elements in the country. Being white was top, being black at least meant that you belonged to one community or another. But being coloured, that was seemingly an absolute negation of the purity of race at the time for the regime. It is a stark reminder of the Nazi influence on the apartheid government, and it is Noah's generation that is left to deal with the trauma of its consequences. Noah has come out of it well thanks to a wonderful tough mother and a sunny predisposition. I sit here and wonder how long still it will take for South Africans of all walks of life to write stories where race is not the central issue at stake. Maybe naive to hope that when nationalism is on the rise globally. The rainbow nation. Without it the whole world would be less colourful. From an outsider's perspective his story is shocking. And yet this is just one man. What of all the others?

These stories are intimate beyond belief, and Noah pulls us into his personal memories of awkwardness, violence and convoluted racism.

The story turns around when Trevor's Mom marries an abusive man, who hates Trevor because he is not his biological child.

 So you have his story. On top of that, you have the very interesting canvas of an Apartheid/post-Apartheid South Africa on which this story is painted.

Okay, I haven't read many (4 or 5), but this is the best yet. Trevor has a way of telling a good funny story. Most of his childhood is not humorous, growing up very poor and having an abusive step-father, let alone the extreme racism in his country, and still he tells a good funny story. Actually the book is very eye-opening about what it's like to live in South Africa. Since there is that lighter side it isn't overwhelming in sadness. I hope his life only gets better.

""Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood."" earns five stars for the wit and humor of the narration. Actually, it deserves five stars that Trevor has made it intact to adulthood! His descriptions about being of mixed race in South Africa are poignant as he delineates how Apartheid worked to suppress the indigenous society of black people around him. His prose has an elegance that is raw and unvarnished. He shows an ability for distilling important life-altering aspects with his inner, childish interpretation and again as a reflective adult. His story never falls into self-pity. 
 Ex.- ""I didn't have any friends. I didn't know any kids besides my cousins. I wasn't a lonely kid -- I was good at being alone. I'd read books, play with the toy that I had, make up imaginary worlds. I lived inside my head. To this day you can leave me alone for hours and I'm perfectly happy entertaining myself. I have to remember to be with people."" 
 My admiration for Trevor's mother is enormous. She is fiercely independent and has successfully raised a son to manhood despite all the obstacles along the way. She had a vision of her ""family."" She determined what she wanted for her son's future and the two of them were a team in that endeavor. She raised him to ""be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone."" (I suspect that of all the things that have gone into making Trevor, ""Trevor"", not even half were covered by this book...)

It is a memoir, a cultural history, a famous comedian's biography, and then some. The subject matter is often heavy, but Noah's perspective and humour can lighten even the darkest moments, and his incisive cultural analysis sets everything in a firm historical context. This book was written for a North American audience and it's very easy to read from that perspective, as he explains anything unfamiliar by citing their American equivalents. For such weighty topics, the language is accessible and engaging. 
 Perhaps my favourite point that he makes is about the difference between physical discipline and child abuse. His mother used to beat him as punishment, but she made it clear why he was being punished, there was a beginning and end to the episode, and she made it clear she loved him and it was his behavior that was at fault. Later on, unfortunately, Noah gets to contrast this with the explosive and cruel temper of his new step-father, making clear the difference between discipline and abuse. This fits with my experience, and it's a point I've tried to make before; I appreciate having this explained in such a clear and accessible way. 
 I do agree with other reviews that the story ends earlier on in his life than I would expect. Hopefully Noah is hard at work on a follow-up book, one that chronicles the beginning of his stand-up career in South Africa and how he eventually made the jump across the pond. 
 This is not just a celebrity memoir. While there is an assumption that you know who Noah is, and that the writer has become successful, Born a Crime can easily hold its weight with other personal and political memoirs that study race, gender, and class.

I could already hear his voice in my head when I read this book, but actually listening to him imitate the voices of those he grew up with was a real treat.

 The story Noah tells is extraordinary, and no doubt more so for a secure inhabitant of the developed world. Life as a mixed-race kid in apartheid South Africa, was complex and challenging at every angle. But Noah is his usual good-natured self as he takes the reader through a fair share of harrowing tales. He is fully honest about the road he has traveled away from his mother's ways, and yet he clearly loves her very much. Since he is not presenting a political program here, he is free with his chosen subject matter. And perhaps what I admire most about him turns out to be his uncompromising stance on the unacceptable effects of patriarchy on the women we love, including ourselves.","Thu Jan 05 15:22:19 -0800 2017","Thu Jan 05 15:29:59 -0800 2017","Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",0,0,""

Honestly I am so out of touch these days I had actually never heard of him until my friend Michele posted about his book. What she said intrigued me so I checked out the audio version. I must thank Michele for this, as from the very first word I was hooked. First off he has a lovely south African accent that I could just listen to for hours, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Its a little bit coming of age, a little bit history lesson of Apartheid and what that really meant and a set of insightful essays that challenge your beliefs and perceptions of the world. His stories are at time hilarious, at at other times heartbreaking and sweet. Truly fascinating and a must read for everyone. Let me tell you, it will make you think of crime in a different way. Sorry this is so brief but things are busy these days, but I still wanted to bring this one to your attention. My fav so far this year.

 ""it's easy to be judgmental about crime when you live in a world wealthy enough to be removed from it"" 
 ""My mother didn't believe in self-pity. ""Learn from your past and be better because of your past,"" she used to say, ""but don't cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don't hold on to it. Don't be bitter."" 
 ""In society, we do horrible things to one another because we don't see the person it affects. We don't see their face. We don't see them as people. Which was the whole reason the hood was built in the first place, to keep the victims of apartheid out of sight and out of mind. Because if white people ever saw black people as human, they would see that slavery is unconscionable. We live in a world where we don't see the ramifications of what we do to others, because we don't live with them. It would be a whole lot harder for an investment banker to rip off people with subprime mortgages if he actually had to live with the people he was ripping off.

 This book is much loved so I'll be swimming against the current, but that's never stopped me from being honest with my thoughts so here goes: 
 Let me first start by saying that I was a huge fan of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and when Trevor Noah joined I gave it six weeks before deciding he was just not for me. Something about him rubs me the wrong way, so I wasn't planning on picking up this book, especially since it was a memoir. Then my local book club selected it for this month and I decided to at least try, maybe I would be pleasantly surprised. That did not happen. 
 I did not know going in that this was a collection of ""eighteen personal essays"" which explains some of the somewhat disjointed style of this book. It was interesting to hear about this mother and the decisions she made, and this is clearly an ode to his Mom, but why would I care about any of this? While I did smile at some of the humor, I found myself mostly annoyed both with him personally and how he talked about his experiences. Was this a difficult childhood, sure, but so what? As someone who grew up in Kenya, there wasn't much he described that was new to me, and the fact that he talks about his ""mischievous"" acts where there were no consequences without a sense of regret was something I found deeply disturbing. The longer I listened the more unlikable he become, and when I got the section of his Matric dance when it suddenly occured to him that he and his date didn't even share a common language I called it quits. 
 I was completely blown away when almost half of the book club members ""didn't know about Apartheid."" How is that even possible? The group had a mixed reaction to the book, with many feeling that he left out significant bits about how he got to host the Daily Show for example. However, given that this book might be a way to introduce people to some of what happened in South Africa I'm glad Noah wrote it. I'm just clearly not the target audience. 
 I listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by the author. I did enjoy listening to his various accents as he switches back and forth between South African languages. I would not have read this far if I'd read it in print, but if you're a Trevor Noah fan, or somehow who doesn't know anything about Apartheid this might work better for you.","Mon Sep 04 15:23:46 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 19 14:22:09 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 08 15:46:35 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 -0700 2017",5,6,"False"

I typically don't do audiobooks but Trevor's narration has me converted. His autobio details life in South Africa. Trevor shares his upbringing and hardships offering a humorous angle on experiences that was otherwise terrible and shocking. He takes you through his childhood and teen hustling days with simplistic yet gripping social commentary. This book inspires and educates the reader, or in my case, the listener capturing my attention and heart right from the beginning. Born a Crime illustrates the history of South Africa and the effects of apartheid in an intimate way as I was able to confront the aftereffects through Trevor's life. The environment that he describes is almost tangible and I felt transported to his home country. I could feel Trevor's sincerity for the love of his country through his words and get a sense of this beautiful bustling community that he describes. My upbringing was so vastly different to the author's but the book didn't alienate me. He paints such a vivid picture I actually felt that I could almost touch and understand his environment. In a way this was a coming of age story minus the usual romance. The way the book was written allowed me to immerse myself in his personal growth and emotions through out his coming of age journey. Making sense of his life with the intensity of a strong culture was something I could relate to.

The whole event outlines how poor the family was but shows it with great humour.

 He is a great storyteller. The tone of the book is that of a guy telling you great stories about his mom, his schooling, his life of crime, his thinking about how to solve problems. Would that we all had moms like his.

 His was an interesting childhood and the book does give interesting insights into growing up in the periods shortly before and shortly after the end of apartheid, with the added twist of being not quite black enough nor white enough to fit in to a society where pigeon-holing people was legally required. 
 His mother comes across as a remarkable woman, his step-father as a total pig, and his bio-father a fascinating but almost invisible man whose story would be interesting enough to make its own book.

It should be required reading for every high school student, and if you're not a high school student, it should be required reading for you and on your to-buy list as a gift for all the readers in your life. 
 I knew nothing about this book before I read it except it was by Trevor Noah, a man whose stand-up I've enjoyed and am now a fan of on The Daily Show, so I was expecting your typical humorous my-road-to-becoming-a-successful comedian memoir. That was not this at all. There is virtually no humor in this book. This is a history of apartheid and the technical end of apartheid, told from the point of view of a child who had a black mother and white father, which made his mere existence a crime. 
 The stories he told were so eye opening. Parts of it sound familiar to stories (in fiction and nonfiction books, fictionalized films and documentaries) of the American experience of the history of slavery and race relations and policing, but parts were jaw-droppingly eye-opening. For example, I never thought about the fact that not everyone is educated about Hitler the way we are today in the U.S. If your only options are to go work in a mine or as a maid or some other form of slavery, you have no reason to be taught history. However, your Dutch and British oppressors do deem it necessary to inflict their religious beliefs on you, and they want your children to have anglicized first names. Many of the kids were thus named after characters in the Bible, but other kids were given names of people that sounded powerful, thus, you might name your kid Hitler. (!) 
 His insights about the difference between committing crime and being a criminal, domestic violence--this guy can really write, and a lot more than just jokes. 
 There are dozens of passages that are quote-worthy--far too many to recount here (which is why you should read his book). 
 He mentions that he started touring as a comedian, and that's it. Not how he got his start, not how he went from being an outsider bootlegging CDs to becoming a headlining comedian. His insights on race are truly illuminating. An outstanding work.

 Even though he's young, Trevor Noah has had a very exciting, if not unorthodox (at least compared to my own) childhood. That was one of the big things I liked about the book. It immersed me in a life that I can hardly imagine growing up in. It gave me a closer look at what life was really like during apartheid and helped me to understand just what apartheid really meant to the people that lived through it. 
 Even though the book deals with awful, hateful things, the tone is generally lighthearted, and there are quite a few funny moments. The end almost had me in tears though. There was what amounted to a huge spoiler right at the start of the book but I couldn't figure out the whole time whether...something bad was going to happen. And then I was dragged through the last 10 pages like I wasn't reading a memoir but a freaking thriller novel! 
 I would recommend this even for people who aren't the biggest fans of memoirs. Also, Trevor Noah's mom sounds like a total badass.

 I never really had much interest in Trevor Noah. I wasn't even aware of him until he replaced Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. Once I saw a couple episodes around the 2016 election, I started to like him, so once I saw that he was releasing a memoir, I knew I had to read it. 
 By now, it's probably obvious that I love a good memoir, and a humorous one nearly always makes for an enjoyable read. I listened to Trevor Noah's book during the peak of the semester when I was too busy to be able to actually read, turning it on each time I got in my car. As I said, I never really knew much about him as a person before picking up his book, but now, I definitely have a new respect for him. 
 He starts out his story by discussing bits of his childhood, growing up in South Africa, born to a black, South African mother and a white, German father, making him a product of interracial relations, a crime punishable by law under apartheid. His story moves mostly chronologically throughout his life, with the exception of tales he inserts about his mother's past prior to his birth. 
 Integrating his wit whenever possible, Noah tells a beautiful story about a young man's journey through a life plagued by racism & poverty, and how the bond between a mother and child can withstand all of that and worse. 
 Even if you've never heard of this comedian before (catch his show weeknights on Comedy Central), his tales of a South African childhood will leave you laughing, crying, and in awe of the beauty in human differences.","Sat Jan 07 09:55:22 -0800 2017","Fri Jun 30 22:55:54 -0700 2017","Fri Apr 21 19:32:35 -0700 2017","Fri Mar 03 07:16:35 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 ____________________ 
 Never have I experienced such alternatively intense emotions as I have listening to this book, where Noah recounts stories of his childhood in truly terrible conditions with humor and matter-of-factness. I had moments where I felt crushed by the realities of Apartheid, wondering how humans can be so cruel, followed by long stretches of laughter where I must have looked batty while driving, such was my delight in a chapter about sneaky pooping (and the aftermath). I'm talking crying laughing, gasping for air, and then eased back into some more sobering tales of close calls, losing friends, running from those who threatened him or his family. It's only January, but this book is absolutely in my personal top 5 for the year. If nothing else, Born a Crime speaks in universals about human experiences, even simple things like learning to speak someone else's native language and reaping the social benefits. It's just set in a world that's very far from my own.

 He might be the baby-faced host of The Daily Show, but he was also raised a mixed-race child during Apartheid. Listening to him narrate the story of his childhood and all of the dangers that came with his very existence showed me that he's a lot more than Jon Stewart's slightly-less-beloved replacement. I may be frustrated recently with his call for other people of color to be moderate in their reactions to the incoming administration, but getting a bit of insight into the pain and tragedy he suffered at the hands of similarly-minded people was informative for me and has changed the way I view him.

However, being from the same country and having my own knowledge to compare against, made this book more engaging than I expected. The humour, which as one would expect coming from a comedian, was good and got a few chuckles out of me. It did become quite dark towards the end, but I didn't mind it at all since it added some extra depth that the book needed by that point anyway. 
 I did the audiobook narrated by the author and I can't really imagine anyone else having done it since there were various cases of non-English phrases (which were followed up by their translation) which he did fluently and with the correct tone. He also used a certain tone and inflexion for when he was quoting himself as a child which was particularly funny. Overall, though, the writing was quite decent and I enjoyed that it was broken up by theme rather than being strictly chronological. I would have liked some info on how he got into his career, but I suspect there was nothing particularly funny about that, so he chose to focus on his various culturally unique quirks and childhood shenanigans. This book really is mostly a series of anecdotes from various stages of his childhood, which if you like that sort of thing, is well done and edited. 
 There really isn't much else for me to say though. It was a nice, short autobiography with a fair amount of humour and some more serious notes thrown in as well. I suspect most South Africans will enjoy it, purely from having that shared context to compare against. It's also definitely quite funny for the most part and so it's quite a light and fun read which is perfect if you need something to read between more serious books.","Tue Jan 31 21:35:04 -0800 2017","Wed Feb 01 20:24:41 -0800 2017","Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 -0800 2017",1,0,"False"

 I don't usually read memoirs or non-fiction (though that has radically changed these past two years). After seeing Trevor Noah take the spotlight of one of my favorite shows, The Daily Show and hearing his stories of his childhood and South Africa I couldn't help but press the 'buy ticket' button when I found out he was going to be in LA to promote his book, Born A Crime. I'll talk about the event later in this post, but suffice to say before and after the show I was devouring the pages. 
 The title pretty much sums it up, really. Trevor talks about various stages of his life during and after apartheid. The voice of the book is perfect. I don't have the audiobook, but when reading this I could hear Noah's voice perfectly. His life experience filled me with amazement, horror and at times, disbelief. Like the majority of Americans, atrocities outside our borders are something we read in textbooks, the reality of it vanished by time and distance. To hear Trevor's personal account of apartheid is sobering and the only way I managed to swallow the horror I felt was through laughter at Trevor's humorous take on his life. 
 And yet, despite the book having his name splashed on the cover along with an image of his own face on a street wall, the real star of this book is Trevor's mother, Patricia Noah. 
 Sure, reading about Trevor's life is the main reason to sit with this book. But in between the youthful shenanigans of the future comedian are mic drop moments of Patricia Noah spittin' words of 'lit' wisdom to her son (or just beating it into him) and she just steals the scene. I remember getting excited every time Patricia showed up again in the book. As Trevor says, they were more than just mother and son: they were partners. He is the Robin to her Batman. Patricia Noah is larger than life. She jumps out of a moving car with Trevor and his baby brother to escape a violent taxi driver. She gets shot in the face by her husband and returns to work a week later. Hell, she even conceived Trevor on her own terms. She asked the only man she trusted and spent time with at that point (a white expatriate man who lived on the same floor as her) to help her have a baby and she got it. She didn't give a fig if Trevor's father stuck around. She just wanted a child. A true lioness, that one. There are too many awesome moments with her that I would end up quoting the majority of the book if I kept going. So I won't. 
 Verdict? 
 Come for The Daily Show. Stay for a badass woman named Patricia Noah. And when is she going to come as a guest on The Daily Show? I think we all could learn a thing or, you know, a thousand from her.","Mon Dec 12 20:26:20 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 12 20:35:10 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 -0800 2016",2,0,""

 Trevor Noah has been a great replacement for Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. He is intelligent, quick, funny, and talented. This book gives a look into the incredible story of Noah growing up in South Africa. 
 The stories are an eye opener as to what it was like living under Apartheid, having a black mother and a white father, and having one amazing mother. Using humor, Trevor documents the hardships, struggles, and prejudice that forged him into who he is today. 
 Some of the stories are described in lengthy detail, some are too long, and some details are repeated unnecessarily. My only objection is that I was hoping to read more of how he became the comedian he is today. Maybe that will be in the next book. 
 At a time when this nation is facing a resurgence of racism, bigotry, and hatred, this story is even more important for everyone to read. It shows just what can happen when those attitudes are carried to the extreme. 
 This one gets four stars, and is a must read.","Sat Feb 04 14:43:28 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 04 14:44:50 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

It was just so compelling, heartbreaking, inspiring and interesting a read. I doubt too many other celebrities can say they've had the childhood/background of Trevor Noah. 
 My only complaint about ""Born a Crime"" is the lack of details as to how Trevor Noah began his showbiz career. Yes, mention was made from time to time about him appearing on television shows, or mentioned in newspaper articles, but no true a-ha! so that's how he got into comedy and his ""big break"". It just seems Trevor went from DJ-ing to stand up comedy/tv appearances with no transition. 
 Another very minor quibble is the lack of resolution with his biological father. I know they didn't have a traditional father-son relationship, but it just seemed to have stopped completely after the entrance of Trevor's stepfather - who intensely disliked Trevor and his mother having any interaction with the Swiss-German. You would have thought that after Trevor left his mother's/stepfather's house, he would have had some level of relationship with his natural father since they did seem to have intermittent familial interactions in the past. Thus, I would have liked more of an epilogue to this. 
 But my complaints are minor. Overall, this was a fascinating read into how Trevor Noah has been shaped by his upbringing and experiences.

It is a story of Trevor's experiences prior to becoming the comedic, mellenial icon we see every week night on the daily show. This may not appear to be directly fixated on his mother, but that's only because a love story can only be genuine when you put your story first; that's so much more intimate than telling someone else's story. It's funny because the title is very political- the beginning is very much like that. Heck! The very legislation that explains the title of this book is cited at the very beginning. It only starts to gets touching when Trevor explains the underpinnings of his birth: his mother's desire to have someone love her unconditionally. Trevor proves throughout his stories that he was perhaps naughtier than expected; he shits where he shouldn't (whatever you think I mean by that- yes), talks back, steals, gets arrested. May not sound morally just on his behalf, but he grows from all these experiences. Noah also puts a good deal of story telling towards explaining the racial underpinnings behind his experiences. He brings up the freeing of Nelson Mandela, race tensions, and legislation throughout this book. And all I have to say is that he did so in such a poignant and memorable matter. I was expecting this book to be as political as the ones endorsed by his Daily Show predecessors, but he managed to make it so personable, humorous, and (wonderfully (the best stories in life are the boring ones you make interesting!) mundane. It reminded me of I know Why the Caged Bird Sings at times. It's for this reason, I can't help but love this book. Much like Trevor, I credit must of my development to my mother's wisdom and dedication. I relate to him on the level of having an absent father figure, as both a result of politics and a cold disposition. I'm a sucker for stories that preach for the power of mama! I cried at very obvious and ridiculous points in this book because I relate to him mocking his mother for her religious reasonings. I relate to him learning how to read and speak English from his mom and not a school (it's big when all he other kids don't speak it). I relate to his frustration with his mother for constantly welcoming people into her life who treat her like crap. I've never willingly written reviews for this site before, but I thought this book deserved it because I only read it because I'm a fan of Trevor Noah- love him, hate him, this book is worth reading.","Sun Jan 15 16:27:05 -0800 2017","Sat Aug 12 01:44:18 -0700 2017","","",2,2,""

It added to the experience. After all, it would be weird to hear someone else telling the biography of another person. 
 A year ago, I learned a little bit about the apartheid that happened in South Africa. It was interesting to read a first-person perspective on someone who's been affected by the apartheid. 
 Trevor Noah also talks about the corruption of power. Not just in the government, but also in people. The apartheid gave more power to some than others, and that made people act a certain way. Sometimes they give back, but others just take and take and take. 
 One quote that really stood out to me was this: 
 ""I don't regret anything I've ever done in life, any choice that I've made. But I'm consumed with regret for the things I didn't do, the choices I didn't make, the things I didn't say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. ""What if..."" ""If only..."" ""I wonder what would have..."" You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days."" 
 It made me pause and think. Because of that quote, I've decided to try and stop worrying what other people think of me and try new things. Who cares if I fail at it? At least I had the experience of doing it. 
 I've got to admit, Trevor Noah had an eventful childhood. I loved the banters between Trevor and his mother. It's clear throughout the book that Trevor loves and admires his mom despite the hardships they've gone through together. 
 Overall, it was a solid biography. It was funny, eye-opening, and serious all rolled up into one book.

I knew it had been on the ""best books of the year"" lists and I had ordered a copy for my library but I didn't pay much attention to it. I didn't even know who Trevor Noah was. I'd just heard the book was good so I thought ""why not?"". 
 Born a Crime is a series of essays about Trevor Noah's childhood and youth growing up in South Africa during Apartheid and afterwards. Trevor is (as the rest of the world except me probably knew) the host of The Daily Show so while the stories cover some heavy and sad topics like racism, poverty and domestic abuse, the essays are also infused with humor. I laughed out loud several times while reading this book and also felt sorry for his mom because he was such a rascal as a kid! 
 Born a Crime focuses on Trevor's youth from his early childhood to his teens. Trevor tells a lot of funny stories about his behavior as a kid and young teen but through it all, it is clear how much he loves and respects his mom. She is smart, caring, loving and deeply religious. She was also a fast runner (and so was Trevor when he got into trouble, which happened a lot). I enjoyed the stories of Trevor's misbehavior and awkward teen years and also the sweet relationship he had with his mom. 
 While this book is entertaining it also looks at some important topics. Trevor talks about the history of racism in South Africa and how ridiculous the whole concept of Apartheid was. Even the differences between the various groups of nonwhites and how the white South Africans set people against each other to keep the system of Apartheid working. Growing up, Trevor had to be hidden by his mom during Apartheid because his existence was illegal as a biracial child. He also talks about not quite fitting in with the blacks (whom he chose to identify with), the ""coloured people"" (people with multiracial ancestry as well as those that the white South Africans decided were ""coloured"" based on random criteria) or the whites. Trevor used his gift of languages to find common ground with his classmates. It helped them realize he is the same as them. Sharing a language brought unity and shows that people are not so different which is why the government did its best to keep everyone segregated. 
 Apartheid ended in the 90s while I was in high school but I didn't really know much about it. I don't think it was something we learned about aside from news coverage on Channel One. Of course we were teens with our own self centered concerns. Reading this book helped me understand more about Apartheid and what life was like under Apartheid. 
 I was able to listen to the audio version of this book as well as reading the print version. Trevor narrates the audiobook which is fantastic. He does a great job with the various voices and accents, especially the Afrikaners (white South Africans of Dutch descent). We had several Afrikaner library patrons at my old library and Trevor's accent was spot on (unlike Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond). I recommend listening to the audio version if you can. Trevor is a great storyteller. 
 I hope you will consider giving Born a Crime a try. It is funny, educational and inspiring and likely to be one of my favorites.","Sun Jan 15 08:04:14 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 04 06:13:02 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

 I have never before left a review on Goodreads about a book I've read. However, this book taught me so much that I feel I need to leave a review. Because after finishing the book all I really want to say is: Thank you Trevor Noah for writing down your story. Thank you so much. 
 The book touches on many topics. One of the parts I appreciated the most was his view on apartheid. I was never taught much about it in school, and Trevor paints a clear picture of what apartheid was like. And how it continues to hurt South Africa, because it isn't just gone from one day to the next. 
 I also really appreciated Trevor's view on life. For one, he broke a lot more rules as a kid than I did! He is more daring I guess. Somewhere in the book he writes: 
 ""I was blessed with another trait I inherited from my mother, her ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the thing that caused the trauma, but I don't hold onto the trauma. I never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something new. If you think too much about the ass kicking your mom gave you or the ass kicking that life gave you, you'll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It's better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on. You'll have a few bruises and they'll remind you of what happened and that's ok. But after a while, the bruises fade and they fade for a reason. Because now, it's time to get up to some shit again.""

It seems at worst, pretentious and at best premature. This isn't a conventional autobiography though, more like essays and thoughts on Noah's life to date. In part I was curious about his background and how it led him to the Daily Show. That part is not included, so you would imagine I was disappointed, but far from it. This is a fascinating story and not just the Trevor Noah parts. Surprisingly (to me), he grew up quite poor and even more surprisingly, his Swiss father does not really provide him with much in the way of advantages, as I had imagined before reading the book. Noah's genetics mean he is an outcast everywhere. Not black, white or coloured (the latter forming a very distinct racial grouping and heritage in South Africa). Each group has its own distinctive culture, heritage and languages and this book is a real eye opener when it comes to the realities of day to day life for all the groups. At various times in the memoir he tells of a time he identified with or joined each colour group. By skin colour alone he belongs with, and is often assumed to be part of the coloured group but this is the group he identifies with least. Issues of race, colour, heritage and discrimination are scattered through the stories but skillfully woven in through the narrative. As always, what you imagine or believe from afar turns out not to be quite the case in every day life, especially in the townships. Regardless of whether you are interested in Trevor Noah, or even South Africa, this is a thought provoking read. It does however include some disturbing elements of child, animal and domestic abuse. This is real life and an honest and intelligent account of growing up in South Africa. Not at all what I expected.","Fri Aug 25 09:28:48 -0700 2017","Fri Aug 25 09:55:27 -0700 2017","","",0,0,""

 Many Americans have come to know Trevor Noah through his work on The Daily Show. In Born a Crime, we can see much more; that Noah's birth actually was a crime in apartheid-era South Africa; that his black Xhosa mother risked imprisonment and expulsion from Johannesburg back to her homeland of Soweto if Trevor's existence were discovered. So Trevor lived a very careful life as a child, rarely seeing his father at times. Subversion was a well-played life game. If Trevor's existence had been discovered he would have been taken away to an institution for mulattoes or coloreds, for labeling was an apartheid pastime. 
 This is the story of one life but also of a country with severe identity issues. And Noah personifies so many of the issues at the forefront of South African life during his lifetime. He was never an acceptable person to many because he wasn't black or white and not accepting of the colored label because he self-identified as black. He didn't know where he fit in, didn't look like his black mother and her family and not like his father. He did not feel he fit the colored label that sometimes included Chinese or Japanese (who at other times were considered white). And he wasn't black enough to be acceptable by many blacks outside his family. The end of apartheid changed all of this legally but not identity-wise for a boy trying to fit in among his school mates, etc. 
 Trevor seems to have been an intelligent child and teen who lived on being funny, acting outrageous at times. Of course nothing about his early life computes for someone not raised under apartheid and then a country trying to find itself after throwing off apartheid and developing new systems. He writes of so many moments that not only bring his life alive for the reader, but bring the reality of life in South Africa for non-whites more into focus. I believed I knew a bit about South Africa's recent history and the end of apartheid. This book has shown me that I know little. 
 I thank Trevor Noah for sharing his story with us, for all of the personal and South African societal detail it provides, that closer look it is important to take. 
 One note on the narrative itself. It does not read in a continuous arc time-wise, and you will find time shifts occurring between what are essentially more separate essays than sequential chapters of his life. Occasionally I found this slightly bothersome but probably wouldn't have had I known up front this was the structure. However Noah centers you throughout with his wit and his much-loved mother.

 I listened to this on audiobook and I strongly recommend for other people to do the same. 
 Trevor Noah is an amazing narrator. I felt like he was telling me his story rather than narrating his book. 
 The story itself was very interesting and I feel like I've learned something about an era and country I know extremely little about. 
 I do however have one pretty big issue with this book: It's narrative structure and rather lack of. Noah jumps from his childhood to his young adult life and back very frequently and amidst it all the chronology of it became a mystery to me. I could very well deal with it on audiobook because of the verbal nature of that medium but I know that it would have bothered me a lot more had I actually read the book myself.","Wed Jan 18 05:58:46 -0800 2017","Tue Apr 18 08:25:44 -0700 2017","Sun Jan 22 01:54:25 -0800 2017","Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

I decided to pick up Trevor Noah's memoir because I LOVE watching The Daily Show. He's charismatic, approachable, insightful, and hilarious, so I wanted to get to know him as an individual rather than a television personality. Noah gives the reader an in depth look on the woman who taught him to be the man he is today and how growing up in South Africa shaped his world views. 
 What Born a Crime does best is educating its reader in a brief history about apartheid in South Africa and what that meant for the people living there. The novel accomplishes this by giving the reader straight up facts about it then framing it within Noah's owe childhood and experiences in a comedic tone. Noah touches upon religion and how it shaped those around him, education, language, race, ethnicity, domestic violence, gender roles, and more. Each of these topics influenced Noah in specific ways that are highlighted throughout the text. A lot of them are introduced through funny stories, but some of them are given the serious weight they deserve. 
 As much as I laughed while reading Born a Crime, it broke my heart just as often. Noah's story is not unique because it happens all too often. Stories like these shed light on topics that would otherwise remain hidden in the shadows. 
 Overall, Born a Crime is a fantastic memoir that does more than tell funny stories. It educates the reader about South Africa's recent past, the injustices faced by many everyday, and the consequences of those injustices. If you're looking for a truly insightful memoir, look no further. Trevor Noah will take you on a journey through his childhood and young adult life that will leave you forever changed.","Mon Jun 19 11:06:28 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 21 09:14:54 -0700 2017","Tue Jun 20 13:14:32 -0700 2017","Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 -0700 2017",7,0,"False"

 I have no connection to Trevor Noah and I mildly know of him. As someone not afraid to pick up a celebrity memoir by someone I know nothing really about, I went in with little expectations. 
 Noah's life is fascinating, especially the time in his country's life where Apartheid was officially over but not really over. There were some points where it jumped around for no real reason (listening to the audiobook; I don't know if there were breaks and it was separated into sections). I did lose interest here and there but overall found it engaging and enjoyable for someone with no context to Noah.

It's a dark story about a boy who grew up with unimaginable horrors just an expected part of daily life.

I watch Trevor on The Daily Show every single night, so being able to learn about his childhood in South Africa really allowed me to gain such an insight into not only his life, but also into an entire culture. The respect I have for Trevor's mother is so significant and this novel emulates how much of a bond she and Trevor have and I really appreciated that aspect of this book. Reading this book was the first time that I also utilized an audiobook whilst reading and I think that in of itself enhanced the my reading experience even more because hearing Trevor talk about his first-hand experiences growing up was hilarious, emotional, and, overall, truly inspiring.","Mon Dec 26 17:21:12 -0800 2016","Wed Mar 22 00:34:51 -0700 2017","Thu Feb 09 12:57:28 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

 I heard the book was good - and it was the Michiko Kakutani's review that really caught my attention- but even with those high expectations, I was still blown away. Born a Crime is storytelling at its best: extraordinary experiences told by someone with an impeccable sense of comedic and dramatic timing. Trevor Noah is both hilarious and tragic, informative and at the same time moving. 
 While some of Noah's anecdotes may resonate with third culture or mixed kids more than those who are neither, the core message of a son's love for his mother, will resonate with everyone. 
 I won't continue by reiterating the praise everyone else has already said. You should just read it.

 What I do remember, what I will never forget, is the violence that followed. The triumph of democracy over apartheid is sometimes called the Bloodless Revolution. It is called that because very little white blood was spilled. Black blood ran in the streets. 211 
 ""But aren't you afraid?"" I'd say. 
 ""There's only one of you and there's so many of them."" 
 ""Honey, I'm not alone,"" she'd say. 
 ""I've got all of Heaven's angels behind me."" 
 ""Well, it would be nice if we could see them,"" I'd say. ""Because I don't think the rioters know they're there."" 
 She'd tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by: ""If God is with me, who can be against me?"" 
 She was never scared. Even when she should have been. 232 
 When the British took over the Cape Colony, the descendants of the original Dutch settlers trekked inland and developed their own language, culture, and customs, eventually becoming their own people, the Afrikaners--the white tribe of Africa. 320 
 In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid. 332 
 If you stop to consider the ramifications, you'll never do anything. 361 
 It was illegal to be mixed (to have a black parent and a white parent), but it was not illegal to be colored (to have two parents who were both colored). So my mom moved me around the world as a colored child. She found a creche in a colored area where she could leave me while she was at work. There was a colored woman named Queen who lived in our block of flats. When we wanted to go out to the park, my mom would invite her to go with us. Queen would walk next to me and act like she was my mother, and my mother would walk a few steps behind, like she was the maid working for the colored woman. I've got dozens of pictures of me walking with this woman who looks like me but who isn't my mother. And the black woman standing behind us who looks like she's photobombing the picture, that's my mom. When we didn't have a colored woman to walk with us, my mom would risk walking me on her own. She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn't hers, like I was a bag of weed. 451 
 Temperance lived with his second family in the Meadowlands, and we visited them sparingly because my mom was always afraid of being poisoned. Which was a thing that would happen. The first family were the heirs, so there was always the chance they might get poisoned by the second family. It was like Game of Thrones with poor people. We'd go into that house and my mom would warn me. ""Trevor, don't eat the food."" ""But I'm starving."" ""No. They might poison us."" ""Okay, then why don't I just pray to Jesus and Jesus will take the poison out of the food?"" ""Trevor! Sun'qhela!"" 547 
 As a nation, we recognized the power of women, but in the home they were expected to submit and obey. 587 
 In America the dream is to make it out of the ghetto. In Soweto, because there was no leaving the ghetto, the dream was to transform the ghetto. 618 
 The spaza shops were informal grocery stores. People would build a kiosk in their garage, buy wholesale bread and eggs, and then resell them piecemeal. Everyone in the township bought things in minute quantities because nobody had any money. You couldn't afford to buy a dozen eggs at a time, but you could buy two eggs because that's all you needed that morning. You could buy a quarter loaf of bread, a cup of sugar. 623 
 The thing that I couldn't handle about the outhouse was the flies. It was a long drop to the bottom, and they were always down there, eating on the pile, and I had an irrational, all-consuming fear that they were going to fly up and into my bum. 652 
 Growing up the way I did, I learned how easy it is for white people to get comfortable with a system that awards them all the perks. 792 
 If you're black in South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. English is the language of money. 825 
 That, and so many other smaller incidents in my life, made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people. 853 
 When she was old enough she stopped working on the farm and got a job at a factory in a nearby town. She worked on a sewing machine making school uniforms. Her pay at the end of each day was a plate of food. She used to say it was the best food she'd ever eaten, because it was something she had earned on her own. She wasn't a burden to anyone and didn't owe anything to anyone. 989 
 My mom told me these things so that I'd never take for granted how we got to where we were, but none of it ever came from a place of self-pity. ""Learn from your past and be better because of your past,"" she would say, ""but don't cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don't hold on to it. Don't be bitter."" And she never was. The deprivations of her youth, the betrayals of her parents, she never complained about any of it. 1006 
 It was when we moved to Eden Park that we finally got a car, the beat-up, tangerine Volkswagen my mother bought secondhand for next to nothing. One out of five times it wouldn't start. There was no AC. Anytime I made the mistake of turning on the fan the vent would fart bits of leaves and dust all over me. Whenever it broke down we'd catch minibuses, or sometimes we'd hitchhike. She'd make me hide in the bushes because she knew men would stop for a woman but not a woman with a child. She'd stand by the road, the driver would pull over, she'd open the door and then whistle, and I'd come running up to the car. I would watch their faces drop as they realized they weren't picking up an attractive single woman but an attractive single woman with a fat little kid. 1066 
 But as shitty as our car was, it was a car. It was freedom. We weren't black people stuck in the townships, waiting for public transport. We were black people who were out in the world. We were black people who could wake up and say, ""Where do we choose to go today?"" 1075 
 On Sunday afternoons after church, we'd go for drives out in the country. My mom would find places with beautiful views for us to sit and have a picnic. There was none of the fanfare of a picnic basket or plates or anything like that, only baloney and brown bread and margarine sandwiches wrapped up in butcher paper. To this day, baloney and brown bread and margarine will instantly take me back. You can come with all the Michelin stars in the world, just give me baloney and brown bread and margarine and I'm in heaven. 1086 
 My mom would always say, ""My job is to feed your body, feed your spirit, and feed your mind."" That's exactly what she did, and the way she found money for food and books was to spend absolutely nothing on anything else. Her frugality was the stuff of legend. Our car was a tin can on wheels, and we lived in the middle of nowhere. We had threadbare furniture, busted old sofas with holes worn through the fabric. Our TV was a tiny black-and-white with a bunny aerial on top. We changed the channels using a pair of pliers because the buttons didn't work. Most of the time you had to squint to see what was going on. We always wore secondhand clothes, from Goodwill stores or that were giveaways from white people at church. All the other kids at school got brands, Nike and Adidas. I never got brands. One time I asked my mom for Adidas sneakers. She came home with some knockoff brand, Abidas. ""Mom, these are fake,"" I said. ""I don't see the difference."" ""Look at the logo. There are four stripes instead of three."" ""Lucky you,"" she said. ""You got one extra."" 1091 
 As modestly as we lived at home, I never felt poor because our lives were so rich with experience. We were always out doing something, going somewhere. My mom used to take me on drives through fancy white neighborhoods. We'd go look at people's houses, look at their mansions. We'd look at their walls, mostly, because that's all we could see from the road. 1112 
 My mother took me places black people never went. She refused to be bound by ridiculous ideas of what black people couldn't or shouldn't do. 1119 
 We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited. 1126 
 My mother showed me what was possible. The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will. 1128 
 People thought my mom was crazy. Ice rinks and drive-ins and suburbs, these things were izinto zabelungu--the things of white people. So many black people had internalized the logic of apartheid and made it their own. Why teach a black child white things? Neighbors and relatives used to pester my mom. ""Why do all this? Why show him the world when he's never going to leave the ghetto?"" ""Because,"" she would say, ""even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I've done enough."" 1136 
 Apartheid, for all its power, had fatal flaws baked in, starting with the fact that it never made any sense. Racism is not logical. Consider this: Chinese people were classified as black in South Africa. I don't mean they were running around acting black. They were still Chinese. But, unlike Indians, there weren't enough Chinese people to warrant devising a whole separate classification. Apartheid, despite its intricacies and precision, didn't know what to do with them, so the government said, ""Eh, we'll just call 'em black. It's simpler that way."" Interestingly, at the same time, Japanese people were labeled as white. The reason for this was that the South African government wanted to establish good relations with the Japanese in order to import their fancy cars and electronics. So Japanese people were given honorary white status while Chinese people stayed black. I always like to imagine being a South African policeman who likely couldn't tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese but whose job was to make sure that people of the wrong color weren't doing the wrong thing. If he saw an Asian person sitting on a whites-only bench, what would he say? ""Hey, get off that bench, you Chinaman!"" ""Excuse me. I'm Japanese."" ""Oh, I apologize, sir. I didn't mean to be racist. Have a lovely afternoon."" 1144 
 Note: LOL 
 My mother used to tell me, ""I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return--and then I gave birth to the most selfish piece of shit on earth. 1161 
 She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her. 1344 
 ""It must have been strange for your family living with a dog that was deaf,"" he said. ""What?"" ""You didn't know your dog was deaf?"" ""No, we thought it was stupid."" 1444 
 Fufi was the love of my life. Beautiful but stupid. I raised her. I potty-trained her. She slept in my bed. A dog is a great thing for a kid to have. It's like a bicycle but with emotions. 1448 
 He just never understood how white people could be racist in South Africa. ""Africa is full of black people,"" he would say. ""So why would you come all the way to Africa if you hate black people? If you hate black people so much, why did you move into their house?"" To him it was insane. 1540 
 My dad's house was simple. Nice, but nothing fancy. I feel like my dad had enough money to be comfortable and travel, but he never spent lavishly on things. He's extremely frugal, the kind of guy who drives the same car for twenty years. 1564 
 You might get a toy, but it wasn't wrapped and it was never from Santa Claus. The whole issue of Santa Claus is a rather contentious one when it comes to African Christmas, a matter of pride. When an African dad buys his kid a present, the last thing he's going to do is give some fat white man credit for it. African Dad will tell you straight up, ""No, no, no. I bought you that."" 1574 
 Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human being. 1636 
 That's what apartheid did: It convinced every group that it was because of the other race that they didn't get into the club. It's basically the bouncer at the door telling you, ""We can't let you in because of your friend Darren and his ugly shoes."" So you look at Darren and say, ""Screw you, Black Darren. You're holding me back."" Then when Darren goes up, the bouncer says, ""No, it's actually your friend Sizwe and his weird hair."" So Darren says, ""Screw you, Sizwe,"" and now everyone hates everyone. But the truth is that none of you were ever getting into that club. 1726 
 Even when I thought I was liked, I wasn't. One year I got a brand-new bike during the summer holidays. My cousin Mlungisi and I were taking turns riding around the block. I was riding up our street when this cute colored girl came out to the road and stopped me. She smiled and waved to me sweetly. ""Hey,"" she said, ""can I ride your bike?"" I was completely shocked. Oh, wow, I thought, I made a friend. ""Yeah, of course,"" I said. I got off and she got on and rode about twenty or thirty feet. Some random older kid came running up to the street, she stopped and got off, and he climbed on and rode away. I was so happy that a girl had spoken to me that it didn't fully sink in that they'd stolen my bicycle. I ran back home, smiling and skipping along. My cousin asked where the bicycle was. I told him. ""Trevor, you've been robbed,"" he said. ""Why didn't you chase them?"" ""I thought they were being nice. I thought I'd made a friend."" 1747 
 ""Trevor, remember a man is not determined by how much he earns. You can still be the man of the house and earn less than your woman. Being a man is not what you have, it's who you are. Being more of a man doesn't mean your woman has to be less than you."" 1842 
 ""Trevor, make sure your woman is the woman in your life. Don't be one of these men who makes his wife compete with his mother. A man with a wife cannot be beholden to his mother."" 1844 
 ""Trevor, don't forget: You're having sex with a woman in her mind before you're having sex with her in her vagina."" ""Trevor, foreplay begins during the day. It doesn't begin in the bedroom."" 1853 
 Maylene was also the only colored girl in school. I was the only mixed kid in school. We were the only two people who looked like each other. The white girls were insistent about me asking Maylene to be my valentine. They were like, ""Trevor, you have to ask her. You're the only two. It's your responsibility."" It was like our species was going to die out if we didn't mate and carry on. Which I've learned in life is something that white people do without even realizing it. ""You two look the same, therefore we must arrange for you to have sex."" 1880 
 I liked Maylene as much as I liked anyone, I suppose. Mostly I think I liked the idea of being liked. 1890 
 There were times when we would be in traffic and we had so little money for petrol that I would have to push the car. If we were stuck in gridlock, my mom would turn the car off and it was my job to get out and push it forward six inches at a time. People would pitch up and offer to help. ""Are you stuck?"" ""Nope. We're fine."" ""You sure?"" ""Yep."" ""Can we help you?"" ""Nope."" ""Do you need a tow?"" And what do you say? The truth? ""Thanks, but we're just so poor my mom makes her kid push the car""? That was some of the most embarrassing shit in my life, pushing the car to school like the fucking Flintstones. Because the other kids were coming in on that same road to go to school. I'd take my blazer off so that no one could tell what school I went to, and I would bury my head and push the car, hoping no one would recognize me. 1938 
 Note: LOL Edit 
 I don't regret anything I've ever done in life, any choice that I've made. But I'm consumed with regret for the things I didn't do, the choices I didn't make, the things I didn't say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. ""What if..."" ""If only..."" ""I wonder what would have..."" You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days. 2021 
 After suffering my Valentine's Day heartbreak at the hands of Maylene and the handsome, charming Lorenzo, I learned a valuable lesson about dating. What I learned was that cool guys get girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool guys with their girls. 2042 
 The white neighborhoods of Johannesburg were built on white fear--fear of black crime, fear of black uprisings and reprisals--and as a result virtually every house sits behind a six-foot wall, and on top of that wall is electric wire. Everyone lives in a plush, fancy maximum-security prison. There is no sitting on the front porch, no saying hi to the neighbors, no kids running back and forth between houses. I'd ride my bike around the neighborhood for hours without seeing a single kid. I'd hear them, though. They were all meeting up behind brick walls for playdates I wasn't invited to. I'd hear people laughing and playing and I'd get off my bike and creep up and peek over the wall and see a bunch of white kids splashing around in someone's swimming pool. I was like a Peeping Tom, but for friendship. 2119 
 While I downloaded music and messed around in chat rooms, I'd dabble in porn sites here and there. No video, of course, only pictures. With online porn today you just drop straight into the madness, but with dial-up it took so long for the images to load. It was almost gentlemanly compared to now. You'd spend a good five minutes looking at her face, getting to know her as a person. Then a few minutes later you'd get some boobs. By the time you got to her vagina, you'd spent a lot of quality time together. 2273 
 In my mind nothing was cooler than the leather coats everybody wore in The Matrix. The Matrix came out while I was in high school and it was my favorite movie at the time. I loved Neo. In my heart I knew: I am Neo. He's a nerd. He's useless at everything, but secretly he's a badass superhero. All I needed was a bald, mysterious black man to come into my life and show me the way. Now I had Bongani, black, head shaved, telling me, ""You can do it. You're the one."" And I was like, ""Yes.

This book chronciles Noah's childhood and adolescence in South Africa beginning with his birth, which gives the book its name. Noah is mixed race, born at a time when sexual relationships between white people and black people was illegal; he was born a crime. This led to a number of difficulties throughout his life; he was too white to hang out with black kids, and too black to hang out with white kids. Yet, Noah grew up surrounded by black people and culture, and found it difficult to understand why he wasn't readily accepted by his peers. 
 Noah is a truly fantastic story-teller, blending the serious topics of race, bigotry, prejudice, and feminism, with his brilliant sense of humour. Anyone familiar with his comedy will recognise this quality. His voice shines through his writing. However, while we may come to this book for Noah's story, the truly fascinating individual of Born a Crime is his mother. Noah's relationship with his mother was paramount in this life, and when you read this book you will understand why. She was a remarkable woman. 
 The book skips around a lot in time frame, and often it was very unclear what age Noah was in particular sections, and this is my only criticism of Born a Crime. It is an absolutely brilliant read, and I am reluctant to paraphrase any of the remarkable stories he tells, because I will do them no justice.

Fellow readers, ""You need to read the memoir, Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, by Trevor Noah! It is absolutely brilliant."" 
 I can confidently say that Trevor is an incredible story teller. I would love to tell you all about the book, but that would just ruin the moments of learning, laughter, and WTF (what the fuuuuuh?) moments that you experience in the process. 
 For those of you who have read my reviews, you know that I often pair my novels with the audible version. It's just something that I enjoy doing for various reasons such as making my morning and afternoon commute enjoyable. Also, when reading memoirs I enjoy hearing the author's voice! Let's be honest, if you wrote your story, who else could tell your story with the proper emotional inflections and tones, better than you. Mr. Noah took the time to perform his own book and the South African accent didn't hurt the performance one bit. 
 That being said I'll write to you my 10 WTF moments encountered while reading this book: 
 1. Trevor's mother, ""Nombuyiselo"" is a remarkable and EXTRAORDINARY human being. You will learn about her from the beginning of the book all the way until the end. I loved her spirit. I loved her courage. In all honestly, she is the one who needs to write a memoir. 
 2. ""GO HITLER! GO HITLER! GO HITLER!"" I almost peed in my pants. This story is too good not to read. 
 3. The Chinese are considered black in an apartheid South Africa yet the Japanese were labeled as white. WTF!

 5. WTF...Trevor, you saw charred bodies in the streets as a child. I could never imagine. 
 6. ""Witchcraft + Trevor Pray + Koko"" THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Couldn't stop laughing. 
 7. ""Two times two is four. Three times two is six. La la la la la. We're talking about fully grown teenagers being taught this way for generations."" WTF....this was education in apartheid South Africa!!!! DAMN!

Belonging to a book club has made me read many a title I wouldn't have considered reading. Don't get me wrong. I read nonfiction, but I knew nothing about Trevor Noah outside of he is a comedian and I'd seen a few clips from The Daily Show. I had no idea he had written a book. 
 Anywhooo, when I read the blurb about the book, I was like, ""Oh no, a depressing book about apartheid in South Africa. At least he's a successful person, so it won't be all bad."" I know, I'm a horrible person, but there you have it. Now that I've read the book, I believe everyone should and it should be assigned to high school classes. This is how history should be taught. I found Born a Crime extremely entertaining and educational. Reading the book felt like watching an amazing movie. I'm going to order the audio because it's the closest I can get to turning the black and white movie in my mind into full color. 
 My favorite aspect of his story is actually his mother. An incredible woman, she was the star of the movie in my mind. Extremely religious, yet progressive in many ways, she refused to be held back by the chains of apartheid. You know how people say if you could have someone over for dinner to pick their brain, who would it be? Well, Trevor Noah's mother would be the person I picked. 
 I wish I could give Born a Crime ten stars, but they only allow five. Read the book, folks, and you'll see what I mean.

Either because the person in question lead a pretty average life (until they became well known) or because they just have nothing interesting to say, or share, about themselves or the world. A lot of the time, celebrity memoirs are just a cheap way to cash in on a person's popularity. 
 Born a Crime isn't one of those books. I've never watched Trevor Noah on TV, or seen any of his stand-ups. But that wasn't necessary for my enjoyment of this book. 
 Most of all I found this book to be interesting. Learning about Trevor's experience of growing up poor in South Africa during and after Apartheid was something I knew little about prior to this. It wouldn't be false to say his life may have been quite average in many ways, but from my own perspective it was so far removed from my own upbringing as to be interesting. 
 Something I thought about when reading the book was the different experience of Apartheid it showed in comparison to Nelson Mandela's autobiography. Mandela spent much of the time in prison so in a lot of ways his experience of Apartheid was abnormal. Whereas Trevor speaks about his regular life before and after which is almost more interesting.","Wed Aug 09 19:05:53 -0700 2017","Tue Aug 15 17:17:40 -0700 2017","Tue Aug 15 17:01:19 -0700 2017","Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 I really like Trevor Noah and I definately think that the audiobook is the way to go with this one but I dont really tend to like memoirs like at all. I made it a fair bit through and really enjoyed all i had read/heard but i found myself getting bored with it. Which is totally my fault and not this books.

Combine this with apartheid's racist restrictions in his South African home, and Noah has plenty of stories to tell. Through each story, the reader learns both funny and touching details of his reality. 
 Noah could have become an angry young man, but instead he chose to find humor in the difficulties. That instinct came directly from his mother, who mixed tough discipline with deep love as she raised her sons. He dedicates his book to her, and it's clear that she shaped the man he is today. 
 I laughed heartily over and over. With both the audiobook and hardcover, I felt like I was almost immersed in his story over a few days time. Trevor gives an incredible performance as narrator, as if we were in his living room sharing funny stories about our lives. Except he is way better at doing accents and voices. 
 Towards the end of the book, the story takes a dark turn as Noah tells about life as the stepson of an alcoholic, abusive man. The laughs slow down, but the heart and soul of the story get stronger. It's the perfect blend. 
 I had the pleasure of hearing Trevor at an author's reading a few weeks ago. He told us a story that's not in the book, and I'll share it here. He asked his grandmother why his mother never wanted to leave South Africa and come see him in the other places he's lived, like New York. His grandmother said (imagine Noah going into her voice here), ""Trevor, some people are butterflies and other people are flowers. You are a butterfly. Your mother is a flower."" 
 I think that story, along with the entire book, will stay with me for a long time. 
 2017 update: I decided to re listen to this during a stressful week, and everything I said above holds true on a second lesson. The laughs are funnier, and the poignant moments are deeper and more touching. I'll never stop trying to understand the perspectives of people from around the world, including those of all colors, and Noah does a wonderful job of sharing his.","Sun Nov 20 06:43:00 -0800 2016","Wed Sep 27 09:40:08 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 -0700 2017",21,1,""

I'm a fan, I like his comedy and I like him as the Daily Show host, and I feel like I finally understand why he was tapped to replace Stewart. 
 Jon had the political background for Crossfire and to defang Ailes' ilk, Trevor has the depth of perspective to steer us through the boomers' last blows. Nothing he encounters in today's America can hold a candle to what he has made it through. 
 I also admire and find edifying how Trevor steers us deftly through his faith and worldview, and yet he doesn't expend a single word in this book trying to sell the reader any of it. Not one iota. Many might read his memoir and be able to shrug, cluck about what an experience he's had, and move on. Many more, I think, might be able to adopt or adapt Noah's experiences into our worldview and be richer for it.","Sun Jun 04 06:32:13 -0700 2017","Thu Jun 15 22:09:51 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 16 22:09:51 -0700 2017","Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

I didn't do a lot of research into this book before I started reading it. All I knew was that Trevor Noah, the host of The Daily Show, wrote a book and it was about his childhood growing up in South Africa. For some reason I thought that this book would ultimately end with him starting his stint as the host of The Daily Show, while also talking about his experiences in South Africa. However, Born a Crime doesn't discuss at all his comedy career, and focuses completely on his life growing up in South Africa. And I captivated every minute of this book 
 I found Born a Crime to be a really powerful book. Each chapter is a little essay on something that happened to Noah growing up in South Africa. The thread tying all these stories together is Noah's mother. She is really something special, and I could feel how much love and respect Noah has for his mother. I really loved that. 
 I learned so much about the country of South Africa. It was interesting, but often sad and disturbing, learning about South Africa. Noah was born when Apartheid was still going on, and I was moved hearing about his experiences under Apartheid. But even when Apartheid ended, things didn't magically become fantastic. 
 Noah had so many poignant things to say. He speaks a lot about poverty, about being black, about racism. He's so intelligent, and that really comes through in this book. I found Noah's comments on language incredibly interesting. He talked a lot about how even though he didn't look black (his mother is black, his father is white), he was raised in a black family, and he would show other black children at school he belonged in their group by speaking the same language. 
 I really loved Born a Crime by Trevor Noah. I cannot recommend it enough. The audiobook especially was fantastic, as it is narrated by Noah himself. He is a fantastic narrator in general, but he really excelled here, as one would expected.This review was originally posted on Quinn's Book Nook","Fri Apr 14 07:30:48 -0700 2017","Tue Jul 18 21:00:18 -0700 2017","Fri May 05 10:40:33 -0700 2017","Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 -0700 2017",1,0,"False"

The end of an era! Why, I remember when Jon Stewart started in the early 00s. I remember the moments of Zen; even Stevphen; all those wonderful moments when one of the anchors would corpse. 
 Ho ho ho. How silly and paltry that 'end of an era' feels now! After the threatening reality of other, much more important eras ending... But I digress. 
 Anyway, so I've been warming up to Noah for the last few months (his Trump is America's first African President skit was genius), and this memoir comes, MAN, JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME. It is sharply observant, socio-politically aware, heartwarming (!?), fun and funny. It ends on a bit of a terrible note - Noah's stepdad was an abusive alcoholic nightmare of a man, and we end with (I guess) the worst day of Noah's life (?) - but it also ends on the same themes it had been weaving in throughout: the stupidity of racism (and the evil of its institutionalization - or its uses for political gain), and the frustrating additional stupidity of sexism. You learn a lot about South Africa along the way, and the realities of growing up before and after apartheid. And you also realize - damn, this dude is a lot more talented than you initially realized. 
 Definitely recommended; and I recommend the audiobook, to get the full breadth of Noah's polyglot abilities and amazing imitations. The dude's only 32 - let's have an update memoir!

 I was super excited when I finally saw this in a bookstore as I'm a huge fan of Trevor Noah and I was really interested in learning more about his South African heritage as apartheid isn't something I knew very much about. Going into this book I expected to laugh a lot and to learn a lot and let me tell you: I was not disappointed. 
 ""Language, even more than color, defines who you are to people."" I loved the insight into how Noah tackled the negative afteraffects of apartheid as a young colored person. By learning multiple tribal languages within his country, Noah was able to connect with people from all walks of life and really bridge the gap between cultures. ""Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says ""We're the same."" A language barrier says ""We're different."" 
 Having grown up as a third culture kid (meaning I grew up in a culture different to that of my parents), I really connected to Noah's feelings about growing up and not always feeling welcome in your own country. It's a point of view you rarely get to see in literature or film and I really appreciated it. 
 I also really loved how he expressed that women held the South African communities together. The entire book really focuses on the impact his mom had on his life and all of her triumphs against where she started. I think it's really important for the significance of women in society to be highlighted, especially by men. The importance of women is written across the pages of this book with such definition, it's empowering. ""Wathint'Abafazi Wathint'imbokodo!"" ""When you strike a woman, you strike rock."" 
 There are some pretty hilarious stories in here from Trevor Noah's teenage years (such as the one of his break dancing friend, Hitler) but there's also some really difficult to digest moments that he retells for us. I learned so much through reading this book, not only about Noah, but about racial identity, politics, history and language. Every essay is incredibly thought provoking and I was often left wondering about all the other people in the world with similar experiences to Noah's and how we don't get to hear enough of them. 
 As you can probably tell through my review, this book is incredibly quotable. It's full of insight into life surrounding apartheid in South Africa, but it also captures the essence of adolescence and growing up. Born A Crime read very similarly to how Trevor Noah speaks on The Daily Show and it still held the same wit and humor, even when talking about incredibly serious topics. Born A Crime was impossible to put down and is a must read for everyone. 
 Born A Crime is inspiring, hilarious, tear jerking and real. It's the story of Noah's humble upbringing and how his experiences shaped who he is today. Noah's relationship with his mom and their entire lives in general are truly miraculous and I have so much respect for both of them. This book is worth the read, more so than most. So give it a chance. It won't let you down.","Fri Jan 13 15:06:58 -0800 2017","Tue Feb 07 12:25:14 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 ""People love to say, ""Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he'll eat for a lifetime."" What they don't say is, ""And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod."" That's the part of the analogy that's missing."" 
 ""If you're Native American and you pray to the wolves, you're a savage. If you're African and you pray to your ancestors, you're a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that's just common sense."" 
 This book was filled with remarkable quotes. Trevor's observations on race and class are articulate and insightful. His anecdotes are both entertaining and thought provoking. Not only do they open up our American perspective to South Africa's history of apartheid, but he seamlessly parallels that with the struggles we currently face in this country. The color of his skin allowed him access to various worlds and he was observant enough to notice how the power structure worked and how it didn't. His quote about teaching a man to fish really resonated with me. The US not only has a profound problem with addressing race, but its also not even close to addressing class. I liked the guy okay from his Daily Show hosting, but this book made him someone I respect for their wokeness. If you want to think critically about these subjects while enjoying some often funny and heartfelt stories, I highly recommend this book.","Mon Mar 06 19:47:15 -0800 2017","Tue May 02 06:14:33 -0700 2017","Tue May 02 06:14:33 -0700 2017","Tue Mar 28 10:05:13 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

(One of the rare books that I recommend actually hearing rather than reading - it wouldn't be the same without hearing it from Noah himself!) Born on the brink of the country's decision to end apartheid, Noah was a biracial child - highly unusual then AND now. His warm retelling of growing up poor but highly optimistic in various neighborhoods is absolutely enchanting. The love and respect Noah has for his mom practically jumps into your ears, and his use of different voices to mimick various family members (including little Trevor) are beautiful and, in the case of his childhood self, frankly adorable. He's able to keep you fully engaged and smiling even as he delves into deep issues that include racial identity, domestic abuse, endemic poverty, and racial violence. I literally could not stop listening to this book despite the many hardships he and his mom endured together, even when I saw what was coming and wanted desperately to avoid it. 
 Thankfully, the book ends on a happy note. You'll be shocked and horrified at what Noah and his family lived through even while laughing at his youthful pranks and antics. You'll giggle and cry, and close the book full of gratitude and hope for humanity.

 Trevor's voice shines throughout. I'd love to hear him read it. 
 I'd like to hear the omitted part of this story, which I assume is Trevor's meteoric rise to international fame. His (legal) career is mentioned hardly at all, and I find his success all the more interesting given his tough breaks and illicit activities as a youngster. (Host of the Daily Show? How's this kid not in prison somewhere?) I think there's one bit where he's like, ""I did a little stand up"" and another where he mentioned he had hosted a (television?) show. And that's it. 
 In retrospect, it was almost like the story he wanted to tell was that of his family and friends, and the politics that shaped their circumstances. And he included himself only as much as necessary to tell that story. 
 Anyway. 10 out of 10. Recommended to everybody.

It was pitched as being a funny but also important look at what life was like for Trevor Noah growing up during South African apartheid. The way it was described, it sounded like it was going to be more of a comedian-memoir than a serious examination of race issues... Indeed, it was funny at times, and Noah did discuss racism with a compelling perspective from his personal experiences. I would sooner say this book has more serious and thought-provoking content than humour. He does strike a precise balance of bringing in comedy at the right moment to lighten the mood, though. Also, he does indeed get up to some pretty ridiculous shenanigans during his childhood and adolescence. It was very well done and I was astonished by what a tough background Trevor Noah has. He has been through a lot of things that I was not expecting to hear about in a comedian's memoir. 
 I was not completely satisfied with the ending, because it stopped somewhat abruptly. There was some sense of conclusion, but I suppose a book about a young person's ongoing life is unlikely to end with a happily ever after. I won't give it away, but some crazy things happen, some twists that I did not see coming!

 Born A Crime By Trevor Noah 
 I had hard bits and pieces of this memoir before I read it so I knew this was not going to be a funny romp but rather Noah telling mesmerizing, moving, powerful stories about everything from how his birth was literally a crime (it was illegal to have mixed race babies), how he had trouble feeling like he belonged either with the whites or the blacks in South Africa to even darker topics like dealing with domestic violence in his family.

The capacity to laugh at our own helplessness is the biggest gift life can ever give you. 
 Trevor Noah has hilariously made the readers aware about the pathetic principles of the racist regime. In a country where you have to choose sides basis your skin color and if you choose the wrong side you might even die, Noah's mother Patricia chose her life on her own. Neither white, nor black, a ""colored"" Noah never fit in, so much so that he did not fit in his own home. 
 ""Because I don't know how to hit a white child,"" she said. ""A black child, I understand. A black child, you hit them and they stay black. Trevor, when you hit him he turns blue and green and yellow and red. I've never seen those colors before. I'm scared I'm going to break him. I don't want to kill a white person. I'm so afraid. I'm not going to touch him."" And she never did."" 
 Despite being the naughtiest, Noah escaped his granny's whipping and many other punishments just because he was colored - biracial, a near-white born from a white father and a black mother, but didn't escape some other punishments which might have cost him his life. The ridiculous, inglorious law mechanisms during and post Apartheid in South Africa stare in the readers' face like an exasperating, impotent truth and Noah doesn't mince words while mocking them. 
 ""Only Catholics can eat Jesus's body and drink Jesus's blood, right?"" 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""But Jesus wasn't Catholic."" 
 ""No."" 
 ""Jesus was Jewish."" 
 ""Well, yes."" 
 ""So you're telling me that if Jesus walked into your church right now, Jesus would not be allowed to have the body and blood of Jesus?"" ""Well...uh...um..."" 
 - So goes one of the conversations of Trevor with a catholic nun. 
 Patricia Noah's character has sparkled so beautifully throughout the book - her fight against the patriarchal system, domestic abuse, her thirst to ensure her child doesn't turn out to be a weakling amidst the chaos of the society - she has shone brightly and gracefully. 
 Trevor Noah is not a great literary writer, neither has he attempted to sound like one. The memoir is lucid, straightforward, blunt as blunt could be and yet doesn't fail to give much learning about the country and its long tryst with mistreatment. It has some beautiful anecdotes from Trevor's childhood and some wonderful lessons he learnt and the book is absolutely not devoid of some amazing quotes. 
 ""I believed that Fufi was my dog, but of course that wasn't true. Fufi was a dog. I was a boy. We got along well. She happened to live in my house. That experience shaped what I've felt about relationships for the rest of my life: You do not own the thing that you love. "" 
 ""I don't regret anything I've ever done in life, any choice that I've made. But I'm consumed with regret for the things I didn't do, the choices I didn't make, the things I didn't say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. ""What if..."" ""If only..."" ""I wonder what would have...""

 Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He's attracted to independent women. ""He's like an exotic bird collector,"" she said. ""He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.""

Apartheid came to an end during his childhood, but he still never fully fit in with any group because there were no other mixed-race people his age. 
 This book allowed me a deeper understanding of how apartheid worked and the years after it ended. Trevor Noah's experiences growing up would have held a lesser man back, but he thrived despite or because of them. The stories are at times horrifying but are also interspersed with Noah's humor, keeping it from getting too heavy. Noah's mom sounds like an amazing woman. I highly recommend this book!","Wed Mar 22 19:45:39 -0700 2017","Sun Apr 02 15:20:01 -0700 2017","Sun Apr 02 15:20:03 -0700 2017","Wed Mar 22 19:45:39 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

Expectations or none, I was surprised by Trevor's story, as much as I was appreciative of the historical/geographic details relating to South Africa and apartheid. From light heartedness to intense drama, the memoir played havoc with my emotions. I highly recommend Born A Crime, especially to Trevor Noah's Daily Show fans who, like me, might have no insight into who he is. But something was missing, that maybe I did expect, but I won't say because that might be considered a spoiler in an off-handed way. I'm hoping for book two.

Soweto has 50 plus townships where blacks, Indians, and colored people were displaced or forced to live during Apartheid. Nobel Peace prize winners Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu lived on the same block in Soweto and its face has changed over the years reflecting a growing black middle class. Trevor's raw look growing up in post-apartheid Soweto in the 1990s, whose population is over 1 million today, is riveting. 
 ""Born a crime"" is how he describes his birth as it was illegal for a white man and black woman to be together in the 1980s. His Swiss dad and Xhosa mom didn't marry when he was conceived, but even then his life was dangerous because of his light skin. He didn't know anyone else whose heritage was of black-and-white descent making unique situations for him and his mom. If he was with his dad, his mother had to walk on the other side of the road. Or if his mother was walking with him and the police came by she'd have to drop his hand and pretend he wasn't her child or else she would be accused of kidnapping a white person's baby. 
 The overarching theme in Trevor's book is honoring the tenacity, cleverness, and education his mother gave him growing up during a time when there were not many opportunities for South African blacks. He gives personal details interspersed with nonfiction facts that are helpful in understanding the current climate and culture in South Africa. For instance, I'm baffled as a foreigner by the crazy minibus taxi drivers that overload their vans with passengers and drive through lights, drive on sidewalks, drive on walkings paths, drive through fields, stop anywhere they want to pick up passengers, block lanes, and seem to pride themselves in their maniacal driving. In six months I've seen them almost hit a person walking as they spun out of control on the shoulder, tip a van over on its side driving too fast on a roundabout, and go over an embankment trying to pass another van, to name a few. There has been a turf war too, where drivers from two groups shot and killed each other because one group was taking what others considered their routes. Turf wars are common and Trevor describes this hell-on-wheels, gang-like transportation system that most of the population uses to get to and from work. His harrowing experience in one of these taxis and getting tossed out of it while it was moving as a nine-year-old is one of many stories that will keep you flipping the pages. 
 Trevor's experience in different schools shows the variety of learning experiences that influenced him and his gift with languages that allowed him to be liked by different groups of people, while at the same time, remain an outcast. I didn't understand when he wrote about the Bantu education system and had to look that up on my own. Basically, the 1953 Bantu education act extended Apartheid to black schools and implemented an inferior and racist education system that denied black children the same educational opportunities as white children. 
 The chapters about Trevor's abusive stepfather shooting his mother execution style and threatening others is frightening in its portrayal of the violence Trevor dealt with in his life. It's amazing that his mom survived her gunshot wounds and joked about it with Trevor in the hospital. The mix of humor and seriousness helps balance the dark spots and makes for an engrossing read. While I enjoyed the book I did think the pacing was off. The end felt rushed and too much time covered leaving me with questions. 
 Also, some parts of the plot are not always in context and the last chapter repeats a beginning part, but none of this takes away from an easy-to-read authentic tale. In the last chapter, I wasn't quite sure if the mom was engaged. And did others in the group get shot at like her fiance? It sounded like it. His brothers and his relationship with them are not always clear and Isaac's age conflicts with the age Trevor says his mom was at this time. The editing seemed sloppy in parts. But these are minor details. The excellent character development of Trevor's stepfather's dual sides of being charming and violent show a complex person. The relationship with his biological dad is heartwarming and heartbreaking. Many things are done well such as how there was no recourse for his mother with the police and how the justice system didn't serve her. Trevor's love for his mom holds the plot together giving it cohesiveness even if the context is uneven. I hope he pens another book explaining his journey to the US and breaking into national media.","Wed Feb 15 21:53:22 -0800 2017","Wed Feb 15 22:38:58 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 16 23:07:23 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 -0800 2017",4,0,""

Not even a little. No Jon Stewart name drop. Nothing. This was about Trevor's family: particularly his infinitely strong and capable mother who dedicated her life to showing her son a world of possibility despite their many struggles. 
 Sure, there is humor in this book - but really, it's the book on race, privilege, religion, etc. that our country needs. It doesn't take an empty stance on race - it drills holes in the very concept of race and stereotypes: it explores how people are victimized but also how they allow themselves to be victimized. It shows racism in many forms - and Trevor is the perfect narrator - because he was a kid who defied easy stereotypes and easy grouping. He was a kid who could blend into almost any group but never be considered a natural member of a single one. He was a kid who found himself EVERYWHERE on the grand spectrum of power and privilege at different points of his life and in different situations. 
 I have never known even a moment of my life outside of a privileged situation. It doesn't make me a a bad person - but it DOES make me ignorant. It's a type of ignorance that I'll never really graduate from, but this book is one of the few resources I've encountered that left me just a little more enlightened about what it means to live with or without privilege. 
 I promise you - this book offers a fresh and honest perspective that our empty public media discussions of race and stereotypes deprive us of. It will both reinforce and challenge your world view....and yes, it will make you laugh. Trevor is heartfelt and honest - and I am genuinely inspired to turn back to the Daily Show and support him. I know now that Jon Stewart picked Trevor Noah because he was a man with a gift for bringing people together. I can't wait to see Trevor grow into his role and let down the barrier of humor like he does in this book. When he does, he will inspire people. (P.S. Listen to the audiobook narrated by Trevor Noah - his emotion and fluency in multiple languages will keep you connected to his story).","Mon Jan 02 05:56:31 -0800 2017","Fri Jun 02 05:00:23 -0700 2017","Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 -0800 2017",1,0,""

 This book is brilliant. I couldn't tell you the last time I read a non-fiction book. In fact, you could say I'm extremely wary of them because they might be too wordy, or too boring, or too confusing, or any other number of excuses. This book was anything but that. Trevor Noah is a mastermind at retelling his life story while interweaving bits of history and humour into an otherwise bleak childhood. He writes as if he were sitting down and having a conversation with you, and I never felt overwhelmed, despite his story having absurd amounts of racism, abuse, poverty, and violence. I'm thankful he is so adept at balancing the darkness with funny anecdotes and witty remarks. 
 Despite knowing barely anything about Trevor Noah, other than he's a comedian and now hosts The Daily Show, I now have a tremendous amount of respect for the man. I'm grateful for his story and new knowledge I have about South Africa that I sadly might not have had I not read this book. His story is going to stick with me for a long time and I feel sorry for any memoirs I read after this, because this was amazing.","Sat Feb 04 09:24:48 -0800 2017","Fri Jul 21 20:08:19 -0700 2017","Sat Feb 11 18:57:34 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 11 08:33:36 -0800 2017",2,0,"False"

 I found the book excellent for 4 main reasons. 
 The first one is that Mr. Noah keeps you longing for more, because he always gives enough away in advance for us to know that something dramatic might happen soon, without us knowing what exactly. This is a writer's classic weapon. I won't dwell on it. 
 Secondly, and more importantly, Mr. Noah has a unique way of narrating life lessons, failures and resulting wisdom. 
 Obviously, I was not the only child born to black and white parents during Apartheid. (...) Once Mandela was elected, we could finally live freely. Exiles started to return. I met my first one when I was around seventeen. He told me his story, and I was like, ""Wait, what? You mean we could have left? That was an option?"" Imagine being thrown out of an airplane. You hit the guornd and break all your bones, you go to the hospital and you heal and you move on and finally put the whole thing behind you - and then one day somebeody tells you about parachutes. 
 (...)Language, even more than colour, defines who you are to people. 
 Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human being. 
 I don't regret anything I have ever done in life, any choice that I've made. But I am consumed with regret for the things I didn't do, the choices I didn't make, the things I didn't say. 
 People love to say ""Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, 
 and he'll eat for a lifetime."" What they don't say is ""... and it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod."" 
 Thirdly, I found the book to be a historic treasure, because it helped me like nothing else to understand the different layers of society, religion and race that the Apartheid consisted of. 
 Soweto was designed to be bombed--that's how forward-thinking the architects of apartheid were. The township was a city unto itself, with a population of nearly one million. There were only two roads in and out. That was so the military could lock us in, quell any rebellion. 
 The whole issue of Santa Claus is a rather contentious one when it comes to African Christmas. A matter of pride. When an African dad buys his kid a present, the last thing he is gonna do is give some fat white man credit for it. 
 This people had been so fucked by their own construct of race, that they could not see 
 that the white person that they were looking for, was sitting right in front of them. 
 Finally, there is a treasure of amusing expressions and sentences in this book. 
 It was like Game of Thrones with poor people. 
 The Bible was not written in English, but the Bible came to South Africa in English, so to us, it's in English. Which made my prayers the best prayers. Because English prayers get answered first. How do we know this? Look at white people."" 
 In the car, he insisted on driving me as if he was my chauffeur. ""Master must always sit in the back seats."" I never challenged him on it. What was I going to say? ""I believe your perception of race is flawed grandfather.""? No. I was five. I sat in the back. 
 We didn't eat chickens, we obliterated them. Our family was an archeologist's nightmare. 
 Is that the girl? -Yes. -You can take the BMW. 
 When you make the effort to speak someone else's language, even if it's just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, 'I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being

Trevor Noah is relatively unknown here in the U.S. prior to his Daywalker documentary and his new role as host to The Daily Show that he took over for John Stewart, but he has quickly become a voice from South Africa that i truly admire. 
 His book is a collection of interesting stories that almost work as parables to lessons he learned in his life. He was born in South Africa to a Black woman and White man during the Apartheid when it was illegal for the races to mix, hence he was proof of their 'indiscretion'. Which gives him the title for his book ""Born a Crime"" his very existence was a crime. 
 His book contains stories of naughty child who had a strong wise mother and family who often did not know how to contain this child they often had to hide from the public in fear that he might be taken away or his mother prosecuted for her ""crime"". 
 there are stories full of laughter as well as some that are truly heartbreaking and give a darker glimpse into daily life struggling with poverty, finding an identity and abuse. 
 You will walk away having cried, laughed and hopefully a bit wiser. You start the book thinking that Trevor will be the hero of his own story, but by the end you realize that Trevor's Mother is the strong heroine of his life, she instills wisdom, patience and tough love that makes you wish for such a parent. 
 Trevor himself has called this a Love letter to his mother, and i couldn't agree more. They were a team and Trevor is a product of that love they shared.

He's actually done an incredible job, if you ask me. He has a dry humor but a knowledge of American culture and politics that, while not as extensive as Stewart, is deep indeed. 
 This is Noah's story about his life in South Africa. Some parts are extremely funny while many are just plain sad. It's amazing that he made it out of there as is a normal human being - albeit funny as all get out. 
 For that he owes his mother. She was an independent black who bucked the system just enough to succeed. She decided she wanted a child by the Swiss man she had been seeing but wouldn't marry. He eventually agreed and was part of Noah's life until his mother's marriage to a jealous man kept them from visiting his father. But his father never really lost touch. When Noah looks him up as a grownup, he discovers his father has kept a scrapbook of any public mention of Noah. 
 Because his mother wanted him to be a success and have a chance to get out of the stilted system in South Africa, she made Noah learn English as his first language. He also picked up hers, his step-father's and several other of the more common South African languages, including Afrikaans, the language of the Dutch exploiters who created the apartheid system. 
 Noah grew up partly under apartheid. He knew the strict color code and was an outcast according to it. There were categories for white, black, colored and Indian, but none for mixed. (Colored meant that somewhere along the line blacks and whites had mixed but the offspring had married other mixed so the lineage was not strictly white-and-black.) Because of that he learned to blend in wherever he could. He was light enough to almost pass as white, and in situations where identifying with the whites was the best choice, he chose them. He wasn't entirely white, so when the situation was right, he identified with the blacks. Identifying with the coloreds was hard because they were very violent and Noah was not, so keeping up the pretense of being colored was hard. 
 He was also a nerdy kid, very smart and a bit chunky with extreme acne as a teenager, so he again didn't really fit in anywhere. At one of his schools he became a ""runner"" - he was so quick that he was always the first in line at the small shop that sold the students their lunches. So he took orders from five people each day, for a cut of course. He also developed a sense of humor to deflect any difficulties he ran into. 
 In fact, he was so fast that he could beat any other runner in his schools. Again, his mother was responsible for this. When he did something wrong, if he could, Noah would take off running and Mom would come chasing after. Not like most Moms, where they give up after a little while. SHE was very fast too. In fact, Noah and his mother won all the running contests at school functions. 
 Perhaps the most stunning example of the split between the whites and everyone else came in an episode where Noah and his friends were asked to perform their song and dance at an all-cultures event at a Jewish school. Noah had built up an incredible collection of music from illegal downloads which he then burned onto CDs and sold. Because that collection was on his computer, he could serve as a hip-hop DJ without having to have vinyl. 
 The group had one dancer that was the favorite everywhere they played. They had become accustomed to yelling out his name and saying ""Go, go"" and encouraging him while he danced solo. Unfortunately his name was......wait for it........Hitler. Really. Truly. 
 In South Africa at the time, blacks and colored were turning away from traditional names and looking for English names. Because they were never taught history in school - if they went to school - they had to get their world news from what went around. During WWII, they only knew that Hitler and Mussolini were men who fought against the English, who, of course, were part of the oppressors of the natives. They had no idea of these men's politics or beliefs. 
 So here is Noah and his group shouting, ""Go, Hitler! Yay, Hitler!"" in a Jewish school. Neither side understood why the other was upset. 
 This is more a memoir book than an autobiography. It doesn't give Noah's life in start to finish order. It's more a collection of events and people who made him who he is now. Noah is a great comic and it turns out, he's a great writer too.","Wed Dec 14 14:59:41 -0800 2016","Wed Dec 14 15:29:25 -0800 2016","Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",1,0,""

 This biographical account of Trevor Noah's childhood was both lighthearted and amusing and informative and critical. Detailing his life growing up in South Africa with a single mother, this book is full of fun stories and fond memories but also deals with the racism and discrimination he faced and details how he and his mother had to break many laws that told them what they could and couldn't do in their attempts to live good lives. Born a racially mixed baby, his very existence was illegal. Keeping his identity secret was of the utmost importance to his family. He certainly made it difficult though, as he couldn't seem to stop causing trouble. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Trevor's personality really shines through and his trademark cynicism and sarcasm is hilariously present despite the eloquence of the writing. The last book on my BHM reading list for this year, I feel I really made a good choice. The writing wasn't overly formal, but it was informative about the politics of South Africa and the laws of segregation. A quick and fun but conversely heavy read.","Tue Feb 28 07:48:03 -0800 2017","Thu Mar 02 07:50:19 -0800 2017","Thu Mar 02 07:50:19 -0800 2017","Tue Feb 28 07:48:04 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

 This was such a powerful read! I think it was my favorite read of the year. Trevor is great at storytelling and also talking about heavy subjects, while not being depressing. This book is a must read! It deals with race issues and culture differences in such a upfront, yet enlightened way. I recommend this book to everyone. 
 Side note: my husband got me started at watching Trevor Noah's stand up comedy and I remember saying ""this guys needs to write a book!"" I appreciate Trevor as a comedian and public figure, but I always thought the stories, from his childhood, he told in his comedy routines were too heavy to be laughable. I felt guilty when I laughed, the things he makes jokes about shouldn't be funny. 
 In this book, Trevor tells stories of his childhood in a lighthearted, but not hilarious, way. Which I find is much more fitting.","Tue Apr 25 08:50:29 -0700 2017","Wed May 03 13:20:59 -0700 2017","Wed May 03 13:20:59 -0700 2017","Tue Apr 25 08:50:30 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Has he started his CD business?) I couldn't give you an actual timeline of events, and I *just* finished. 
 The writing is definitely of someone who does not write for a living, which makes it raw... in the bad sense. This book felt more like a series of unedited journal entries reflecting on Noah's childhood than an autobiography. There were too many flaws for me to focus on the important themes of living in post-apartheid South Africa. 
 All that being said, the most compelling aspect is his mother's unrelenting faith. Her life, as put by her doctor, is a miracle.","Sat Jun 17 11:17:17 -0700 2017","Thu Jun 22 12:07:48 -0700 2017","Thu Jun 22 12:07:48 -0700 2017","Sat Jun 17 11:17:18 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

I was wrong. That being said, it does have some wry humour, but this is a very gritty, very honest account of his early years and it was an eye opener for this middle-aged white woman. 
 I loved the relationship that Trevor and his mother have, it shines through on every page, even if he doesn't always agree or approve of some decisions she has made along the way. She sounds like an amazing lady who has overcome incredible odds to give her son the best possible life. I can't even fathom a world where having a relationship with someone of another race could cause you to be jailed for years, that is just baffling to me. His mother's issues with her ex caused me to shed some tears (some problems are the same the world over and I could really relate) and I marvelled all over again what a strong and also lucky woman she was. You will have to read the book to know what I mean by that! 
 There were a couple of places in this book that were very uncomfortable reading for me, one in particular because I am an animal lover. So I would like to warn anyone who is as soft as I am, there is a graphic description of animal cruelty contained in this book (not perpetrated by Trevor Noah, I hasten to add). 
 Anyway, this was a pretty awesome book and I learned so much more about apartheid than I had any idea about, and what it is like to be born into a society where you just don't quite fit. 
 Trevor has a great admiration for his mother, but I think he is pretty incredible himself, considering where he started from.

Having watched Trevor Noah's stand up shows, it gets easier to connect some of the stories and even hear him talking in your head. Like the time his mom got shot and Andrew called. That was scary but funny was hell. Before I continue, for those of you who prefer audio books, there is one and Trevor does it. Around these parts, everyone loves Trevor Noah, the problem is some do not get why people like him and it almost made me stop reading the book, except I could not. 
 The history and the talk of apartheid makes it seem even more real than it normally seems. Trevor writes about his life how it all started and all that, what is missing is how he came too be where he is. Jumbled thoughts, I guess. Or maybe there is another book on the way. There are so many instances in the book that kind of reminded me of growing up myself. It sort of seems like there is a particular way in which Africans are brought up. Not just those in South Africa but around the continent. How you relate to people, how you behave, how you parents behave. And yes being beaten up is very normal with your mother telling you ""I am not beating you, I am beating the mistake"".

In a nation where apartheid ruled and two different colors of people could not mingle, his coming to being was illegal/ crime that saw him get bullied, hide while other children played and even get smuggled to see his father who was from Switzerland. Thank his mother's christian ways that made them attend 3 different churches every Sunday where he got to mingle with various races that challenged his thinking. 
 Growing up he had it pretty rough but he managed to maneuver by learning all languages in SA that made conversations much easier while reducing racism at the same time. Trevor's mum was a hyper woman who breached laws where possible to achieve her goals that saw her even work as a secretary in various government offices. Through it, she was able to provide a good upbringing to Noah until Abel became his stepfather and hell broke loose. (Drunk, violent, non-provider, shot Noah's mum but she survived). 
 Noah takes a reader through his childhood in an exciting way but he does not dwell onto his success as a comedian or how he even got there. All we know is that he was a good DJ who used to burn CDs and sell out to buses that saw him go out to DJ at parties, and open shop at the hood where he made it big then a radio station took him in and before we know it he was conquering all.

I had heard Noah reference apartheid (of which we spent less than a week on in middle school and never again) and how his family had to walk on separate sides of the street when they went out together and I was curious to learn more. I requested the book and received a copy for free in exchange for my honest review. 
 I loved this book; it's the best I've read all year. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. I want you to read this book. I want to write a review that makes you want to read this book. 
 I didn't really know much about Trevor Noah. I was disappointed that he was selected to take John Stewart's place on the Daily Show because I thought the shoes were too big to fill. However, there are moments of profundity with Noah that are awe-inspiring. He is a few months older than me and, despite our incredibly different upbringings, I really identified with him. I was always in trouble as a child and I never understood the leaps in logic my mother and grandmother took with their religion. I got into the same arguments with them as Noah did with his mom about the will of Jesus. The dialogue in this book left me giggling to myself a lot. 
 When reading this book, it feels like a lot of different stories about Noah's upbringing. However, once you finish it, you realize that it was one big meandering story. It was really hard to keep this story to myself when I was reading it (I've already purchased the book for two people) and so I would read parts I thought were particularly entertaining to my husband. I would try to pick a starting point to read but realized that I needed to start a few pages back so he would get one of the jokes but then that few pages back would need explaining from a few pages further back and so I ended up reading most of this book to him Much to his enjoyment, I must say . 
 I say this book was entertaining but please don't confuse it with a funny humor book. It was terribly funny but in a horribly depressing sort of way. The normalcy of living in a shanty town, sharing a single outhouse with multiple families, sleeping on the floor, of the systemic racism, and all the shit his mother endured is absolutely sickening. It's gross and frustrating and heart-wrenching that anyone lives this way when so many others live well to the point of wasteful. I appreciate the different perspectives and insights Noah brought to the table, particularly the one about his friend, Hitler, and how someone would even name their child Hitler. There are so many good quotes and life lessons tucked into this book. So many. 
 The ending really slaps you in the face. I was stunned. 
 The only thing I'll say against it is that there's no link between Noah's childhood and early adulthood and where he is now. He went from eking out a living hustling to being a comedian. How did that happen? I guess we'll find out in his next book. Which I will buy. For my whole family. And friends.

I'm not sure why there wasn't any New Zealand history taught to us because there was plenty of injustice in our history, but we studied South Africa. I found it fascinating and awful. Those lessons were probably partly to blame for my political views and outrage at social injustices all my life. 
 It was only recently that I heard about this book and I decided I needed to read it immediately. I'm really glad I did. Trevor Noah had a very interesting childhood and this is a collection of his recollections of growing up in South Africa as a coloured child under and then after apartheid. It is called Born a Crime because his mother, a black woman was forbidden under apartheid to have a child with a white man, it was also illegal for his father to have a child with a black woman - basically any fraternisation between whites and blacks was forbidden, having a child who was a mix was proof that this had happened and therefore Trevor Noah was proof of a crime being committed. This book which is chock full of great yarns about what it was like to grow up coloured, unaccepted by both black and white communities and not fitting in with the world in which he was being raised. 
 I read this as an audiobook, narrated by the author and that was a great choice, his voice is great, he reads it brilliantly. Inserting accents and different voices for the various people in the stories, this could have been horrible, but it worked well. The stories in the book are at times funny, frequently shocking and downright horrifying. His was an upbringing which was full of adventure and terror. You need to read the book to find out the details. I loved the short pieces at the beginning of the chapters which gave stats and statistics and anecdotes, l thought those were completely fascinating as they told of life in South Africa. 
 This is nowhere near the usual celebrity autobiography, this is much more gripping, more serious and informative. I'm grateful to our history teacher for suggesting it.","Wed Mar 01 17:59:38 -0800 2017","Sun Mar 05 01:47:41 -0800 2017","Sun Mar 05 09:53:54 -0800 2017","Wed Mar 01 17:59:39 -0800 2017",5,0,""

 I went into this book thinking I'd relate to so much, as I'm also coloured, but I only related to the book's setting because I know some of the suburbs mentioned.

It's difficult to imagine how the charismatic Trevor Noah managed to overcome the unbelievable circumstances of being raised as a mixed child in post-apartheid South Africa. Stories of his hustle and ingenuity in selling pirated CDs as a child are mixed with tales of the hardship of living with an abusive stepfather, and narratives of the pure grit of the only constant in his life - his mother. Trevor's use of humor to lighten an otherwise heavy book is very well done. One of my favorite books I've read this year.

Trevor writes about his life growing up under the consequences of apartheid in South Africa where he faced poverty, violence, and racism. 
 He also acknowledges the privilege and advantage he had along the way such as his amazing mother, who went above and beyond to do everything she could for him, and the advantages he sometimes had thanks to being classified as coloured rather than black. 
 Trevor manages to discuss some really heavy subject matter with wisdom and humor. Just like on the Daily Show, he is great at highlighting the absurdity of a situation, making you laugh, and then following up with an insightful observation. 
 I learned an awful lot about the realities of apartheid in South Africa from reading this book and I also learned a lot about Trevor's character in how he responded and reacted to what was, at times, a very challenging childhood.

Noah is bright, with amazing insights, he is worldly (having hailed from South Africa and performed in Europe before finding his way to the US and eventually hosting the Daily Show). 
 I have long thought that Noah's stand up is hilarious. And I have watched as he grew into his role on the Daily Show. And I know that he was born in South Africa to a Black mother and white father when the very act of consensual sexual intercourse between those two people was punishable by time in prison. I knew all of that, but none of that prior knowledge prepared me for his story as brilliantly told in ""Born A Crime"". 
 His story is as layered and multidimensional as any story could be that is born out of the absurdity of Apartheid (apart hate as he describes it). Noah is not a child of privilege. He is not the child of parents from the intellectual classes making a political statement through their relationship. No, he is the child of an amazing woman - Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - who refused to be defined by or held down by her circumstances. And he is the son of Robert, a white man of Swiss origin who refuses to adhere to laws that make no sense to him. But they are not rebels, so for much of Noah's early life he has to be hidden from the authorities (his very being is an affront to South African rules). 
 Trevor Noah is a master story teller. With every word I was transported to his world - to the angst and anxiety of the teenage boy trying to figure out girls and social pecking order. To the discomfort of ""not fitting in"" because of his parentage and skin color - not white, not black, not ""colored"", not Indian (basically not easily categorized no matter how much South African authorities insist that everyone should be categorized). To the child of a mother who so enthusiastically committed to her belief in Jesus that they go to three (yes three) Church services every Sunday. I loved the imagery - black church, white church, mixed church. As an African-American woman in the US I knew exactly what he meant. 
 And that was the other brilliance of this memoir - although I and my family are eight generations removed from Africa (and from West Africa at that), there was a theme that flows through the book that I could relate to . The superstitious Grandmother - yes I had one of those. The suspicion of cats - yes that was my family. The insistence that only ""white"" folk let dogs live in the house - yes that was my family too. The crazy way that black mothers have to raise their children, especially their sons - Patricia tells Trevor ""if i don't punish you the world will punish you even worse. When I beat you, I'm trying to save you. When they beat you, they're trying to kill you."" Every black mother in America could relate to those words. For us, those words transcend culture and oceans and miles. We know how it feels to raise a son in a world where he is despised. 
 Trevor Noah manages to weave a funny, heart felt story that explains South Africa and explains the peoples of Southern Africa - even throwing in lots of history - while focusing on his own individual story. Brilliantly told! He is only thirty-two and yet his life story is inspiring and entertaining to any reader of any age. 
 Ultimately this is a story about love and faith. Patricia's love for her son and her AMAZING faith. When folks talk about ""faith like a mustard seed that can move mountains"" they should read this book. In fact I highly recommend that all ""so called born again Christians"" ought to pick up this book to really understand what it means to believe. To believe so strongly that you literally are able to save your son from his own worst impulses and the world that works so hard to destroy him. 
 I am a fan! I love that Trevor Noah wrote this book and shared this part of his life with us. And I can't wait for his next edition - there is still so much to share.","Sat Feb 11 16:41:08 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 11 17:22:44 -0800 2017","","",0,0,""

 I only bought it because I love Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. I expected it to be similar to every other memoir I've read this year. But instead it surpassed all other non-fiction I've read and now ranks among my all time favorites. 
 Like all memoirs, I got this on audible, because I love hearing the author read their own lives in their own words at their own pace. And I heavily emphasize here, please if you are going to read this, read it through audio. His different accents, translations, and tone while reading, really should not be missed. 
 That aside, the story is amazing because of the glimpse he gives us into South Africa during and after apartheid as an outsider- never fully accepted by either the white, mixed, or black groups. The stories, the things he and his mother went through, are tragic, shocking, and yet full of humor and love. 
 I finished this book so thoroughly impressed with all Noah has accomplished and with his very intelligent well articulated observations on aspects of humanity like language and race. I laughed (very hard at some points), I cried, I jaw dropped, I yelled ""what?!!!"" aloud to myself randomly like a crazy person...

 With a comedian's sense of timing and a gift for storytelling Noah tells us about never being able to walk with his father in public, to never hold his mother's hand outside. Of hiding indoors with his imagination. But he peppers the stories with an examination of the inevitability of crime in this environment, institutional racism and the unstoppable determination of his mother in the face of all this.

I'm fairly confident there aren't many people who don't know who Trever Noah is at this point. But I may have been the only person who didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book. What I found between its covers was raw and emotional. It was a story of a mother and son. Of abuse but never neglect. It was a story of a life removed from my own but so human I could relate. Noah grew up in South Africa in the last days of and the furor following apartheid. 
 ""On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations--I was born a crime."" 
 Noah was born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father. The laws made it so Noah spent his formidable days hiding indoors. His parents, who weren't allowed to marry, couldn't even be seen together. Noah's mother looked so different than himself, as a result, she couldn't walk through the streets with him. If she did, someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person's child or having committed a crime with a white man by having mixed race child. Their lives dealt with crippling poverty, racism from all sides, and violence. But Noah's deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or prevent her from raising a son she chose to have to be a man who could do anything he wanted. 
 ""She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her."" 
 Trevor's stories ranged far and wide painting a picture of the path to the man we all know and respect today. One story is about going to jail for stealing, or rather not stealing, a car instead of facing the wrath of his mother and step-father. It was a story every inner child can relate to. Another about peddling CDs in which led to gigs as a DJ. One of those parties was at a Jewish school where the crowd morphed from jumping up and down to dead silence when his crew started chanting the name, Hitler. This was two worlds colliding, black and white, neither understanding why the other is offended. Noah tells the story of sitting at the police station, watching a video of himself and his best friend shoplifting, and the police want to know who the white boy is. The exposure on the black and white film left everyone blind by their own prejudice, to the fact that the boy was Noah. 
 I've learned, laughed, and cried through his book. It's an emotional journey and deals heavily with fear, love, and what both will do to push you as a human. I would have liked to read more about how he traveled from South Africa to the United States and made a name for himself becoming the man we know today on The Daily Show.

He has a lot of smart and insightful things to say about growing up during and after apartheid, and he dissects institutional racism in a way that rings all too true for our current moment in America. It's short, very well written, and if you listen to the audiobook like I did, his delivery is perfect (one of those books where the author's narration greatly enhances the content).

The only thing I've ever seen of is, is the time he interviewed Tomi Lahern (and killed her, rest in peace). My mom got me this book for Christmas, and I figured I'd give it a read. 
 I enjoyed the essays on South Africa, its history and culture, much more than the memoir essays. Normally, I like reading about people I don't know, but I found both young and old Trevor Noah to be annoying and unlikeable. I didn't really like Noah until the very very end of the memoir. Perhaps for his fans, he will come across funny or relatable, but I just genuinely didn't like him in his book. The prose was okay, but nothing fancy or exciting. Overall, this was just okay. 
 My biggest issue was a publishing one. The font was way too stiff for a memoir. It's a silly thing, but it severely impacted my reading experience. The font was remisiecnt of that in Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives, which was perfect for a jarring, general non-fiction, but it felt too distant for a memoir. 
 Maybe pick this up if your a mega fan of Trevor Noah, but there's probably some better books on South African apartheid.","Tue Nov 15 17:55:59 -0800 2016","Tue Jan 31 17:12:24 -0800 2017","Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

Race-mixing proves that races can mix - and in a lot of cases, want to mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system, race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason."" 
 There is so much to love about this collection of essays by Trevor Noah about his life growing up in South Africa. He was born during the era of apartheid with a black mother and a Swiss-German father at a time when it was illegal for blacks and whites to mix. He had tremendous strength of character in a world in which he did not have a place. He did not feel like he truly belonged with the whites, the coloreds, or the blacks. Most other children born to parents of mixed races fled the country, so the parents did not have to hide their ""crime."" 
 Trevor's essays shed insight and understanding to South Africa's diverse African cultural population (a country with 12 official languages), life under apartheid, and the aftermath of conditions once apartheid ended. They are full of humor, grit, love and incredible good fortune or luck. 
 Trevor was raised by his mother who was a very resourceful, independent, strong woman who devoted her life to religion and instilling strong morals into her son. She would whip him for misbehaving. They would have long dialogues over what was right and wrong, and when she felt that he could think up arguments faster than she, she agreed only to argue in writing. Letters back and forth would ensue, sometimes friendly and other times more aggressive. She very much shaped who he was, what he became, made him a strong thinker, a fast runner, and who he is today. Interestingly, he also helped to shape his mother. She parented his younger brother differently from how she parented Trevor, because of what he had taught her. 
 This book is so small, yet so expansive. It is full of wisdom, insight, depth, humility and love. To cover topics including apartheid, poverty, religion, domestic abuse, relationships, police corruption and do it all so well is an incredible feat. I highly recommend this book to everyone!

 I watch the Daily Show regularly and although Jon Stewart's departure was a painful one, Trevor has proved himself to be a more than worthy replacement who seems to improve within his own style of comedy, very day. Needless to say, I'm a fan. 
 That being said, being a fan of someone's comedy doesn't automatically translate as being a fan of their memoir [past experience has taught me that]. I'm pleased to say that this is an exception. I started reading this book for it's title and the premise behind it; someone can be born a crime and how I, as a mixed-raced person myself have never thought of how being born as such could be so dangerous. 
 This book is much more than that. The subject of race, racial discrimination, tensions and belonging is found all throughout but it's the various anecdotal episodes of Noah's life that reel you in. He effortlessly transitions between tragedy and humor with an extreme easy that in no way cheapens either. As much as I'd love to discuss them all here, I'll leave it to you to read and laugh and gasp at the various chapters. 
 I would, however, like to comment on one thing: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. This woman, Trevor's mother, is an amazing person. A powerhouse, an independent, forward thinking woman in a culture and time in which that was not encouraged let alone done. She was an extremely devout woman who did not that take any shit and was full of amazing, insight. Many on my favorite passages in the book are from her, excerpts of her advice, her wisdom which she was always ready to offer to everyone who was in need. She is the type of woman, the type of mother I can only hope to become. 
 This is not just a funny book written by a funny man; Trevor Noah captivates you with every single aspect of this book, telling sad, tragic and heart-warming stories with amazing genuineness, humor and awareness.","Mon Jan 30 02:56:15 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 30 03:56:36 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",0,0,""

In each essay, Trevor narrates stories about his life and focuses on a particular memory or event against a backdrop of South Africa's history. The main theme of this book is apartheid and life as a biracial child during this dark period. As Trevor explains, interracial relationships were punishable by law although the whites were freed with a warning while the blacks got imprisoned. He talks about spending his childhood behind closed doors because his family was afraid that the government would take him away and arrest his mother. He also talks of how apartheid separated him from his father. These narrations are emotional and I found myself angered by the injustices that the black people in South Africa went through for so many years. Racism is illogical and ugly and I never knew just how bad it was in SA before reading this book. It is crazy to think that I was born in the same year as Trevor, grew up in Africa like he did but under totally different circumstances. Growing up, I didn't know much about apartheid apart from little bits of information through history lessons and movies like Sarafina. I was 10 years old when apartheid ended. 
 Trevor narrates his story the same way that he presents his standup comedies; mixing reality with humor. I found myself laughing through the chapters and sometimes wondering if I really should be laughing. I mean they are serious issues but Trevor just has his own way of narrating things so that they are serious and funny at the same time. 
 The story takes us through his experiences during apartheid. He also shares his experience with domestic violence. At the same time, this is a story of a man determined to get through a tough life and succeed in a world in which he was never supposed to exist. The stories about his childhood escapades were hilarious. As a self-confessed naughty kid with a funny mom, he had so many hilarious adventures. I also like how Trevor mixed historical background and personal stories to create better understanding of events which is great especially for those living outside South Africa. 
 The final chapter in Born a Crime by Trevor Noah was tough to read. I have heard him speak about his mother getting shot before. If you have watched his standup comedies in SA, then you may have seen that bit about his brother calling him to tell him that their mum had been shot. However, I never knew the circumstances that led to that call. It was heartbreaking to see what his mother went through. It is even worse to think that the same thing still happens especially here. Women get battered while everyone looks away. Sometimes from the outside, it feels hopeless because what can you really do? You can't stop the fights and you can't also call the cops because they will do nothing about it. It was a sad reality. That is the thing about this memoir; his story is my story and everyone else's story. It may not be exactly the same but it is something that everyone knows about and may have experienced at some point in life. 
 Born a Crime by Trevor Noah is a book that I highly recommend to everyone. I am not just saying this because I like the guy and think that he is brilliant and funny (just mentioning it in case it is not yet obvious). However, this is a book about family, a mother-son relationship, friendship, racism and a person's ability to overcome all hurdles in life. It is also a coming of age story. I am so proud of Trevor for all that he has achieved in life. He is an inspiration to all the people who have ever faced any adversity and felt like they don't belong. I think this is an inspiring story for our continent too. I mean watching Trevor touring the world and now hosting the Daily show, overcoming so much to get there....wow! This is an inspiring memoir that will make you laugh and cry through the chapters (sometimes at the same time). If you are looking for a diverse read then you should definitely pick this one. If you want to understand more about South Africa and Apartheid (from an insider's view point), this is the book for you. Seriously though, just get the memoir. It is a wonderful!","Sun Nov 20 21:35:57 -0800 2016","Sun Nov 20 21:41:04 -0800 2016","Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",1,0,""

 This is the first book that touched me so much that I felt the need to leave a comment. This book is funny. It is insightful. It gives you a look into both a culture and a history that many around the world will never know or understand. 
 It also gives you a view into the author's personal life. His struggles with identity but also his conflicted feelings about the abuse he dealt with. 
 I too was abused as a child by my stepfather, and while my mom is thankfully still alive, I struggled a lot with the same feelings that Noah so artfully puts into words. I was not expecting this book to hit so close to home for me, but it really moved me. It made me feel such a range of different emotions throughout. I am just so thankful i decided to pick it up. 
 I love that Noah blends in the african languages so seamlessly. It really adds to the experience and you start to really feel like you understand after a while. It opened my curiosity into the languages of South Africa and now I want to learn more! 
 I hope that you will give this book a chance, I think it is one that everyone should read! Its just all around great!","Sun Oct 08 06:00:54 -0700 2017","Mon Oct 09 01:12:58 -0700 2017","Mon Oct 09 01:12:58 -0700 2017","Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 I initially began this book reading it myself but then the Audible format was reasonable and features Trevor Noah reading it himself. This made the book all that much better. While he does a bit of rambling historically in time, he weaves a story of his upbringing that is a fascinating view of Apartheid, poverty, race in general and the importance of education to pull yourself out of an oppressive environment when the opportunity is available. 
 He also shares a moving part of his life when telling about the domestic violence that his mother suffered at the hands of his step-father and how that affected he and his siblings.

I did so love his witty, honest commentary and I had never heard of this 'Trevor Noah' guy who would replace him. But I needn't have worried. Noah quickly became one of my favourite 'tell-it-like-it-is' comedic commentators on current events and I wanted to know more about him. 
 In his book, through a series of vignettes, Noah shows his readers what life was like for him as a bi-racial child, who never felt like he really fit in, during post-Apartheid South Africa. He shares funny, loving, awkward and negative aspects of his childhood and many of his descriptions of the harsh realities of living in South Africa at that time will hit you like a punch in the gut. He was a self-proclaimed sh*t disturber as a child and teenager and some of his antics made me want to yell ""What the heck were you thinking?!?"" He definitely liked to stir things up. 
 ""The names of the kids with detention were announced at every assembly, and I was always one of them. Always. Every single day. It was a running joke. The prefect would say, 'Detentions for today...' and I would stand up automatically. It was like the Oscars and I was Meryl Streep."" 
 I respect his brutal honesty and I love, love, LOVED the special, yet often complicated, bond he had with his mother -- the ultra-religious, determined, fierce, rebellious woman who wanted so much more for her son. Though a few of her parenting methods may surprise some, her deep love for her son is indisputable. 
 She'd say things to me like, ""It's you and me against the world."" I understood even from an early age that we weren't just mother and son. We were a team."" 
 Growing up I learned about Apartheid in school but I know I only got the bare gist of it. In stark contrast, Noah brings a human side to the economic and social aspects of segregation, hatred and the blatant violation of human rights and basic decency that one group withheld from so many others. 
 ""Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says 'We're the same.' A language barrier says 'We're different.' The architects of 
 apartheid understood this. Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were separated not just physically but by language as well...The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite: convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it's easily tricked."" 
 ""People love to say, ""Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he'll eat for a lifetime."" What they don't say is, ""And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod."" That's the part of the analogy that's missing."" 
 This book is filled with wonderfully quotable tidbits (far too many to list here). The only thing I regret about this book is that I couldn't get my hands on a copy of the audiobook. Having Noah read the book to me would have been the icing on the proverbial cake. 
 Before reading this book, I was already a fan of Trevor Noah. I enjoyed his honest yet humourous approach to current events (and his dimples didn't hurt either). He's obviously a well-informed and funny guy but, after reading this book, I have a better understanding of where he comes from. Trevor Noah will make you laugh, cry and give you much to think about. The hype surrounding this book is duly given. I highly recommend this book.","Sat Apr 29 12:06:27 -0700 2017","Thu May 18 07:48:14 -0700 2017","Sun May 07 16:04:24 -0700 2017","Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 -0700 2017",2,0,""

I loved so much about this book, but especially the relationship between him and his mother. It was so real and full of love, which meant that there was also plenty of conflict along the way. 
 I knew very little about South Africa and the apartheid before reading this book, and learned so much from reading it. Noah painted such a picture, one that was hard for me to wrap my head around, of the world he lived and grew up in. 
 I think one of the most interesting things about life in South Africa was the way he talked about race, which was obviously a very significant issue. It was interesting to me to hear him discuss the difference between ""colored"" and ""mixed"" people, and how they were VERY different things in South Africa. To be mixed was somehow acceptable, while being colored was proof of a crime, and had to be hidden. His discussions of having to choose between black and white were also interesting, and how even though he felt one way, the color of his skin had people assuming he belonged to another group. Those discussions of identity and inclusion were really interesting. 
 One of the other pieces of the book that really stood out to me was a section where he talks about language being more important than color. He talked about how, if someone can communicate with you, you feel like they understand you, even if your skin color isn't the same. This really got me thinking, and I totally understand that. In another part of the book he mentioned that even trying to communicate with someone in their own language sends a strong message that you WANT to understand or help them, because you're making an effort to reach them in their own language, even if you don't speak it well. There was a lot of discussion about the different languages spoken in South Africa, and the kinds of messages it sent to be able to speak various ones. 
 Another section of the book that really struck me was in a chapter where he talks about his friend Hitler, and discusses the difference between Western culture and the rest of the world, the way Western culture doesn't really often acknowledge the atrocities that didn't concern them. And yet, in South Africa, the atrocities of WWII were significant, but not covered in schools the way they are in Western schools, because that part of the world is so far removed from them. He talks about some of the horrific massacres of black people that have occurred, that so few people know about because no one bothered to track how many black lives were lost. He said at one point ""Holocaust victims count because Hitler counted them."" No one bothered to count the blacks massacred because it didn't matter to them. That really struck me, and made me so sad. 
 I absolutely adored Noah's mother. She is a hurricane of a woman, and it was amazing to me how she persevered through so much adversity to live the life she wanted to live, and give her children good lives. 
 I really loved everything about this book. It expanded my worldview, and though there were plenty of times it shocked me or made me sad, it also highlighted the power of compassion, perseverance, and love.","Tue Mar 07 09:10:18 -0800 2017","Tue May 23 16:21:09 -0700 2017","Tue May 23 16:21:09 -0700 2017","Sat May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2017",4,7,"False"

Technically this is a celebrity memoir since Trevor Noah is a celebrity on the Daily Show, but it's well-written and interesting and looks exclusively at Noah's childhood and teenagerhood, before he was really a celebrity. Born during Apartheid, Trevor was literally ""born a crime"" since it was a crime for a black person and a white person to be together and have a child. He speaks about race, poverty, and family troubles without ever veering into depressing (maybe because you know he eventually made it out). 
 Noah himself narrates the audio recording and he does a nice job of it. It's always nice to hear a memoirist read his own words; it feels like he's sitting down and telling the story of his life.

Now, at age 32, he's published his memoir. If that seems premature, it's only because you haven't read it yet. The title of Noah's book, Born a Crime, is an indictment of the apartheid system into which the South African comedian was born. 
 More than an autobiography, Born a Crime is a child's eyewitness account of life under apartheid and the upheaval that followed when that regime ended. The book's also a tribute to Noah's feisty, outspoken mother, Patricia. A member of the Xhosa tribe, Patricia defied the law by having a relationship with white businessman Robert Noah. Once Trevor was born, the couple couldn't be seen in public as his parents. They enlisted a mixed race neighbor to pose with Robert and Trevor for ""family"" photos. The Black woman standing in the background of those photos, pretending to be the nanny, was Trevor's real mother. 
 Noah finds humor and pathos in this bizarre upbringing. On a more serious note, he also speaks out strongly against domestic violence. Many years after her relationship with Noah's father, Patricia married Ngisaveni Shingange. Noah recounts in chilling detail the gradual escalation of violence in the household and his mother's struggle to leave Shingange. The decision almost led to her death. His stepfather's threats against Trevor's own life were one of the reasons the comedian turned his sights to a career in America. 
 Clearly, Noah has packed a lot of living into his short life -- and this book only covers the first 25 years. Fans of books by The Daily Show alumni Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart will enjoy reading Noah's autobiography, but it will also be of interest to anyone curious about life under apartheid.

Noah is the successful host of The Daily Show, the satirical American news show on Comedy Central. He was born in 1984 during apartheid in South Africa to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father. His parents could have been jailed for five years for having a mixed race child, and Noah could have been sent to a state orphanage. He spent much of his childhood indoors at his grandmother's home with his cousins for playmates since it was dangerous for him to be seen outdoors. 
 Post-apartheid, Noah went to school but he felt like he did not fit in because of his mixed heritage. Noah had picked up multiple languages from his mother and other people so he used language to be accepted in school and on the street. ""I became a chameleon. My color didn't change, but I could change your perception of my color. If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu. If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn't look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you."" (56) South Africa has 11 official languages so Noah's facility with languages was important. 
 Noah's mother was a secretary who tried to expose Noah to the world. She was also very religious, and Sundays were spent going to multiple churches. Money was tight, but she made sure her son went to good schools and had books to read. Even when things were hard, their senses of humor always came through. When she married Noah's stepfather, Abel, their world changed. Although Abel was a good mechanic, he was a violent person when he was drinking. Noah left their home when he finished school, and continued his business of copying and selling pirated CDs for a few years. He also worked as a DJ at dances. Eventually he went on to become an internationally known comic. 
 This book is dedicated to his mother: ""For my mother. My first fan. Thank you for making me a man."" Noah's stories are sad and humorous at the same time. There's a wealth of knowledge about South African people in this book. Every time I put the book down, I wanted to get back to it to read more.

 I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what happened in South Africa, and how this affected its people. There is something very sad about a government that uses prejudice and hate as a tool to keep their people oppressed but its not uncommon and its a great way to keep people preoccupied while you take advantage of them to have more power. 
 But I digress. This is really an autobiography about someone who led a very interesting life. It's told through the eyes of his innocence. He knew no other life. He had to pretend that his father didn't exist because it was a crime to be half black and half white. They couldn't walk together as a family. 
 But that's not all. The twists and turns of Noah's life was directly related to the complex prejudices of his culture. Still, he was just a kid, trying to make his way in a harsh world. On top of this, Noah is funny. He can laugh at the irony of it all which makes it much easier to read. That doesn't change the fact that some of the things that happened in his life were very dark and could make us angry. He just made it easier to swallow. 
 This is a MUST read for anyone. I highly recommend it.","Tue Sep 05 08:59:55 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 05 09:09:34 -0700 2017","","",0,0,""

Trevor writes with a personable style, but each story is prefaced by background information on a particular aspect of South African life that he then addresses in his personal anecdote. We learn about his Xhosa African mother and his Swiss/German father--that having ""relations"" with someone of another race was strictly forbidden in South Africa, hence his birth as a biracial child was literally a crime. And yet, even what race one was classified as could change on the whim of a government official! Trevor really had a difficult time as a 'colored' boy in South Africa, where he was too white to fit in with black children and too black to fit in with whites. One thing that often helped him was that he knew several languages--his mother's Xhosa, English, but also Afrikaans, and Zulu and other tribal languages--this let him fit in with any group he came in contact with and avoid getting beat up. He learned to be a bit of a chameleon in that way. His mother is an amazing woman, who raised him as a single parent for much of his childhood, in really tough circumstances--she overcame so many obstacles in her stubborn clever way. After reading this book, I would love to meet Trevor's mother, because she sounds like such a brilliant strong woman. He describes his other family members with funny and touching stories about them. His stepfather, however, is not such a good man--alcoholic, abusive, with an unpredictable temper, he makes Trevor's life much more difficult. In the book Trevor writes about his childhood--he was kind of a wild child, and became adept at outrunning his mom!-- and young adulthood, when he made a living in ""the hood"" bootlegging CDs and Djing parties, and hanging out with petty thieves and criminals but not really one of them. It's quite a story and very engagingly told.","Thu Nov 24 08:02:55 -0800 2016","Wed Nov 30 17:15:34 -0800 2016","Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Thu Nov 24 00:00:00 -0800 2016",2,0,""

Thankfully, our Supreme Court decided that antimiscegenation laws were stupid and racist. This was good, because if that decision hadn't been made, I may not have been born. See, I am the product of a bi-racial marriage, a marriage that might never have happened if my parents lived in one of the states in which bi-racial marriages were illegal. 
 It's weird to think that antimiscegenation laws even existed in the first place, but it's even weirder to think that law enforcement in those states actually tried to enforce them. Logistically, it makes me wonder how they could enforce them. It's thoughts like this that make me realize that the conservative argument against overreaching federal laws that restrict state's rights, in some cases, completely falls apart. 
 It's been said that morality can't be legislated, but laws that prevent racists from doing stupid, racist things like attempt to enforce antimiscegenation laws can be legislated, and they should. It may not change how a racist thinks---and, most likely, won't---but it changes how a person behaves by punishing racist behavior. 
 Of course, if you thought the U.S. had it bad, you should look at South Africa's history. 
 Stand-up comedian and host of The Daily Show, Trevor Noah, was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. The country of South Africa was, inarguably, one of the countries with the most blatantly racist governments in the world. 
 Apartheid was an institutionalized attempt to segregate, dehumanize, and eradicate black people. It was nearly successful, through a propaganda campaign that pitted blacks against blacks along often arbitrary lines. Sometimes it was based on a person's tribal affiliations. Sometimes it was nothing more than one's skin color: light-skinned vs. dark-skinned blacks. 
 As Noah writes in the opening of his book ""Born a Crime"", ""The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all. (p. 3)"" 
 Under apartheid, it was not only illegal for blacks and whites to marry, it was a punishable offense for blacks and whites to even be seen together in public. Bi-racial public displays of affection of any kind could get one arrested. Jail time or heavy fines were doled out for simply holding hands. 
 Noah's parents bucked the system. Noah's father was a white German expatriate living in South Africa. His mother was a young black woman who belonged to the Xhosa tribe. Their brief sexual encounter resulted in Trevor, who was, quite literally, born a crime. 
 Thankfully, apartheid ended during Trevor's childhood, when Nelson Mandela came to power. Unfortunately, the country quickly became a chaotic mess after vast swaths of black people who were, essentially, being paid slave wages in enforced jobs found themselves ""free"", which also meant ""unemployed"". 
 Noah's book is a memoir, of sorts, written in a series of vignettes and essays. Some of them, like his stand-up comedy, are hilarious. That he was able to find humor at all in some of the bleakest and most depressing of situations is impressive, to say the least. 
 Some of the stories, however, paint a sad and disturbing look at the horrendous aftermath of apartheid. The effects of apartheid's destructive stronghold on the black people of South Africa are still being felt today. 
 The prevailing motif throughout the entire book is Noah's love and admiration for his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, who single-handedly raised Noah through much of his childhood. Not an easy job, according to Noah, who admits to being extremely unruly and awful as a child. If any of his stories that he recounts about his childhood are true, then he truly was a little monster. 
 Still, despite being a single mother, she managed to keep food on the table and provide Noah and his younger siblings an education, a home, and love. 
 ""Born a Crime"" is an extraordinary story that is alternately funny and moving. There are parts that one can't help but laugh hysterically, and other parts where it would behoove one to have a box of tissues handy. 
 While not the best of writers---Noah writes the way he speaks, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, because he speaks like a stand-up comedian, so he has a great sense of timing and detail and knows how to build up a story toward a punchline---Noah nevertheless possesses a passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter that makes it a great read.","Mon Oct 24 10:06:02 -0700 2016","Wed Mar 01 05:52:30 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 -0800 2017",7,0,"False"

 I don't know much about Trevor Noah besides his work as a replacement for Jon Stewart. I've never watched his show and I've never heard his comedy. 
 The book is highly recommended and I picked it up for my book club, excited for something a little different. 
 Trevor Noah narrates his own audio book and I picked that because of it's easy access. I think the audio book is the only way to listen/read this book. His voice, accents, language tells his story in a way that would be lost in written form. 
 In Born a Crime, he talks about growing up in South Africa-where being a mixed race was literally illegal. His life and misadventures fall a little flat to me-to be honest. There aren't a lot stories that stick out from the book. 
 The thing, or rather, the person that sticks out in the book is the power of his mother. The book should be called, My Mom-the Saint. His mother made him who he was and shaped him in ways that I can't understand. She inspired him with food and books-the two essentials they lived off in his early years. 
 As a mom, I take a lot of validation from his story. I worry so much about providing for my children and their happiness. I worry that I'm hard on them and push them too hard/fast. He has this wonderful quote near the end of the book that says something like, ""Relationships are sustained by love. If you love someone, you want to create a better world for them."" At the end of the day, isn't that what we should strive for, not just our children and families, but what about strangers? 
 Born a Crime is full of little gems, thoughtful inspirations for life. Beyond the gems, I know more about Trevor Noah and life in South Africa. 
 Definitely worth the read, at least once.","Thu Mar 09 09:05:36 -0800 2017","Tue Mar 21 11:02:11 -0700 2017","Tue Mar 21 11:02:11 -0700 2017","Thu Mar 09 09:05:37 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 Trevor's simple but perfect way of writing transports you into not only his life but into South Africa pre- and post- Apartheid. 
 From his childhood and early adulthood, Trevor teaches us about racism, apartheid and the multitude of problems of his country. In his narrative he is honest, genuine and heart-breaking. 
 When approaching this, you can't think of him as the new host of ""The Daily Show"" or a celebrity, but just as a man from South Africa telling you this unbelievable story. 
 Trevor talks about apartheid, he explains to us reader (that like me aren't partiularly familiar with South Africa's history) what it was actually like growing up in that time: the corruption of the police, poverty, church, faith, racism, feminism, equality and more. 
 At that time in South Africa he was actually born a crime: his mom is a black woman and his father is white, something that was illegal . He describes how difficult it was for him to identify in a specific group: is he black? is he white? Is he black enough? Is he white enough? 
 I can't stress this enough: this book will be one of the best things you will read. 
 One of the best things about ""Born a Crime"" is Trevor's mom Patricia. What an incredible woman. 
 Her life lessons included in the book are some of the best pieces of advice I have ever heard. 
 I can't even process what I have just read... I'm feeling lots and lots of emotions right now and I can't think straigtht.

As I've mentioned in probably every non-fiction book review I've ever written, I love reading about something which I know little. I learned so much about South Africa in the 1990's and was able to make many distressing connections to the poverty and prejudice described by J.D. Vance in his memoir of growing up in Appalachia, Hillbilly Elegy. Parts of Trevor's memoir made me LOL and other parts had me wiping tears off of my face.

This is what Trevor Noah tells us in his memoir. Born a Crime is an apt title for this book, since it refers to the fact that Noah's very birth was a crime. He was of mixed race parentage with a black South African mother and a white Swiss father. As a coloured person, who was brought up in a black culture, Noah did not feel at home with any group. It made for interesting reading since Trevor brought up all the different facets of his life seen from his unique perspective. 
 The stories are presented in snippets, so it is not a linear description of Noah's life. But most of the chapters were interesting and you begin to get a sense of what a background of racism and poverty can do to someone even if they have the opportunities to get ahead. Noah escaped the vicious cycle because he managed to find a job he loved. But before that, he wasted time hustling even when there was no need for it. All this because he wanted to fit in, and the only people he felt comfortable with were poor people with nowhere to go. 
 This biography is intensely honest, which I appreciated. The murkier aspects of Noah's own behaviour and that of those he loved was not glossed over. For example, Noah's mother was annoying. She didn't spoil the book for me, because the human interest element was pretty high. But I began to find Nombuyiselo quite unsympathetic at some point. Her crazy religiousness was putting her life and that of her son's in danger and she would not admit it at all. It was not impressive, it was darn foolish! 
 But this is what oppression is all about - there is no scope for critical thinking. The scourge of apartheid remains in South Africa, decades after its official ending. Gender imbalance is rampant, and so is violence, poverty, and crime. Criminals are at the helm, and poor people live like they always have. 
 One thing that annoyed me about this book was the Americanisation. Everything was described and explained from an American angle, instead of just describing it as it is. For example, a store was described as the American version of Target. Why would I care? This was done consistently and I began to lose any feel of reading about South Africa, which was a great pity. 
 Born a Crime is not a comprehensive look at apartheid, but it is a great snippet to get you started. Noah's humour shines through in places, and after reading this book, I am convinced that he is a good comedian.","Fri Jun 02 22:36:56 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 09 20:32:14 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 07 07:55:06 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 -0700 2017",10,4,"False"

 This is a powerful book. Of course there is humor in the book, but this is a serious book. I can identify with Noah in a number of ways while finding new insight into a life I can't imagine. 
 Noah paints pictures with his words, illustrating the meaning of privilege in a world of inequality. He shows how poverty can trap generations of people who work hard to escape without the tools and education to do it. The struggle of domestic violence and loving someone who hurts. 
 I did not expect to be confronted with the weight of the serious topics. Nor did I expect the time of honesty and disclosure that surfaces in the book. 
 For me, this book have me a glimpse of the pain that bias puts people through. Not just racial bias. Noah shows that answers are easy to give while solutions are difficult. I see the reality of a sin sick world that can only be cured by God. I do not know where Noah stands in relation to God (he does not shy away from profanity), but he gives the testimony of his mother a spotlight for the world to see the power of her faith. 
 I would recommend this book to those who are interested in better understanding prejudice and poverty and the subtle ways society contributed to these forces. Noah uses profanity liberally, so that is something a reader will have to consider in approaching this book. For myself, what I gained from the reading well outweighed the profanity.","Sun May 21 09:02:39 -0700 2017","Fri Jul 07 19:29:00 -0700 2017","Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sun May 21 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

When Jon Stewart announced that he was leaving the show last year, like most fans I was basically crushed. How could he leave?! And who was this Trevor kid? No, seriously, he looks like a baby. How can this child replace JON flippin' STEWART? But as I watched the new host settle into his role, I actually began to like him. No, he wasn't Jon Stewart--but he also wasn't trying to be. He brought a completely different flavor to the show. He was still funny--but his background and perspective were different, intriguing. So when I first saw he had a memoir coming out, I knew I wanted to read it. 
 I have a track record of being disappointed by books written by newly-famous celebrities. (Somehow they tend to come across like they were written just to keep the gravy train rolling...) But this book. THIS BOOK. Holy smokes, it is so good. Never mind that it's written well and that Noah has a great sense of humor and self-awareness about all the Ish he's had to endure in his life. What I love most is that the book absolutely surprised me. I wasn't prepared for where it went--or, rather, I wasn't expecting this to be what Noah's childhood was like. I guess I thought if he was able to get his own already-popular show, he must have had more than a few connections and handouts. And who knows, maybe he did eventually meet the person who knew The Person. But he certainly went through his fair share of Terrible Horrible before he got where he is now. 
 For example, Noah grew up in apartheid South Africa and was raised mostly by his mother (since his white father couldn't be seen with him in public). His stepdad was a colossal dick and did some truly, truly horrible things to the family (especially his mother, yeesh). He was incredibly resourceful. He was chunky. He had bad skin and was very unpopular in school. He was also a troublemaker. He could run really fast and managed to evade cops more than once. 
 The point is, this is one of those books that doesn't go anywhere you expect it to. I can't begin to say how much I love it when someone's personality or life story surprises me--and I especially appreciate it when a person turns out to be a scrappy-as-hell survivor. 
 My only very minor complaint is that the book ended too abruptly. I needed a few more pages telling me where Noah went from that last horrific act he describes in the book. Is that what propels him to go to America? I just needed more closure. But other than that, I absolutely loved Born a Crime. It's one of the best memoirs I've read all year. (Along with 32 Yolks, if you're looking for another good one...) :D

Noah discusses his earliest days of joy, where he would run around completely isolated from the realities of his world. He grows, causes more trouble, and tries to forge relationships with friends and his elusive father. The story continues through his mother's various tribulations with men, the staggering effects of poverty that creep into every decision they make, and the building of his career...as a young petty criminal. The book ends just at the early moments he starts making a dent in the career we are familiar with today. 
 Now, the best part of the book has little to do with what one might have expected. Sure, there are some extremely funny moments (my favorite was an ill-fated DJ set with one of Noah's peers), but what this book provides is an uncompromising study of the effects of, causes of, and results of poverty on young minority men (and I am using that term loosely as Noah's race has a big role in the book, constantly shifting social alliances with good illustrative and literal reasons) in Johannesburg, but honestly all over the world. His approach to these important issues is fun to read, making all the difference in a book that needed to be written now more than ever. He covers crime, unemployment, healthcare, family, alcoholism, and every major issue affecting the low-income families of the inner city. Noah has an incredible ability to formulate an extremely important and misunderstood argument against what much of the American rhetoric says about poverty and crime, and he uses the form of his memoir to illustrate - to show and then explain - how this all works in the context of a dangerous urban environment. He is accurate, engaging, entertaining, and the lessons his memoir provides are extremely important to society today. 
 This was an enjoyable read - and I will likely adopt this in my classroom in reading both memoir and discussing social justice. While this was definitively a memoir, the message it carries is unflinchingly, bravely, beautifully bold.","Thu May 25 11:02:33 -0700 2017","Thu Jun 22 19:10:01 -0700 2017","Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Growing up poor in South Africa on the tail-end of apartheid, Noah's childhood was tragic, complicated but also filled with the typical pre-teen moments of self doubt, broken hearts and the longing to fit in. What makes those typical moments atypical is coming of age under government-mandated racial separation, where not only were South African's citizens divided between black and white, but black and white and Indian and Chinese and ""colored"". Being born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Trevor fell into the category of ""colored"" yet struggled to fit in with any particular group, whether they be black, white or ""colored"". Trevor recounts fond memories of his strong-willed and determined mother who loved him unconditionally, despite her family's reluctance to accept him as one of their own. He explains what it was like being a child under apartheid, and how the government not only wanted to separate white from black, but aimed to fracture the divide even more by isolating the Xhosa, Zulu, Pedi, Tsonga, etc., who would maintain their own language, and therefor be unable to communicate with each other. Because he is a comedian, there are of course very humorous moments and observations, but the overall tone is quite serious. Obviously life for Trevor Noah now is much different from his upbringing, but his journey of how he got there is inspiring.","Sun Nov 27 08:59:26 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 29 15:59:58 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 29 15:59:58 -0800 2016","Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

I've been disappointed at some of the material from comedians like Amy Schumer and Caitlin Moran because I'd expected their sense of humour to translate perfectly to the written word, and for me, it did not. But Trevor Noah has a true story to tell. It is by no means a literal transposition of his stand up sketches, but you recognise the same brand of humour and his authorial voice is strong: you can hear his voice jump off the pages. The human truths he talks about are universal, and yet he gently adds to our layers of understanding about the issues of post apartheid South Africa and how everything is not as simple as it is can appear from the outside. It is not a triumph of one side over the other, there is no right vs wrong but many many shades of grey, and for many South Africans, freedom created as many problems as oppression (""The world has been taught to be scared of him but in reality he's scared of the world""). You can see, smell and hear the environment he conjures so vividly (""There is something magical about Soweto. Yes it was a prison designed by oppressors, but it also gave us a sense of self determination and control... in America the dream is to make it out the ghetto. In Soweto, because there was no leaving the ghetto, the dream was to transform the ghetto"").

 Born a Crime is raw, almost disturbingly so, yet exploration of his South African upbringing. Noah's casual, rather matter-of-fact way of dealing with the tragic and horrific details of his childhood are hard to read, but necessary. 
 Trevor loves his mom and the relationship between these two is heartwarming and wrenching. She's fiercely independent, yet also comedic in her child-rearing approach, so you see where Trevor got his wit. 
 But, when he uses this literary style to convey everything from South Africa's draconian miscegenation laws to the systemic poverty and institutional education policies that crippled many Africans during Apartheid, slightly diminishes the gravity of the issues at hand. He's strives for laughter, however for me, the tone was disquieting. 
 I won't give away the end, it involves his mother and if you've heard any of his interviews for the book, he tears up when he talks about it. Let's suffice it to say that like so much of the book, he takes a topic like domestic violence and treats it with such a subtle and matter of fact tone, that you ""almost"" forget that what he's conveying is yet another tragic aspect his life. 
 It's clearly a survival mechanism, I just wished that in some cases, he'd have been a little bit more serious, but then, he wouldn't be a comedian.

 It's so interesting because Trevor Noah has had so much happen in his life that this book essentially only covers his birth through early adulthood. None of his experiences in the media are discussed here. 
 But there is SO MUCH that has happened and is discussed that it makes his rise to fame, that much more astounding and amazing. 
 A great writer, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because there seemed to be a lull in the later quarter of the book (SPOILER: After his friend is arrested for stealing and before his mother splits up from his step-dad).

Noah himself explains how from a young age he was born a criminal, to a Swiss father and a Xhosa mother, during a time when such a union meant a lengthy prison sentence, and he explores his early life very well indeed with some great writing, and some added elements of humour that really work and helps his story feel authentic. 
 If you aren't familiar with Trevor Noah as a comedian but this memoir sounds interesting enough for you to read then you might want to consider watching a few episodes of his show or a few clips on Youtube first to get an idea of what he's like. The Memoir may not go into great detail about The Daily Show - in fact, it barely mentions it, because most of the focus here is on Noah's journey throughout his childhood. He explores several incidents such as one time where he was caught on camera shoplifting with his friend and whilst his friend got caught he wasn't recognised, whilst at the same time explores his relationship with his family, namely his mother, very well indeed. 
 The book is fast paced for a memoir and moves through events quickly, and it's a fairly short read so you'll be able to speed through this in a couple of sittings. I'm not overly familiar with South Africa and the apartheid but Noah manages to tell a insightful and story with a lot of heart. I know I mentioned that it might be a good idea to watch some of Noah's standup comedy or his work on The Daily Show to get a good idea but that is only optional as you could probably dive straight in without any further information needed. Even though there is humour that is not the main focus of the book, as it explores Noah's background incredibly well making it a must read. It might not quite be the best memoir that I've read this year but it's certainly up there.","Tue Nov 15 14:10:20 -0800 2016","Sat Dec 10 08:09:49 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",3,1,"False"

 So, it's basically like watching the Daily Show, if Noah was presenting his life instead of the news. You can hear his voice as you read his writing, and you have an idea of how he wants it delivered. 
 But on top of that, you've got his actual story. He lays out his upbringing in South Africa and gives the right amount of context to help us understand the implications of a biracial kid's existence during and immediately after apartheid.

I picked it up at a friend's house, with no context or background, and it immediately pulled me in. I knew Trevor from the daily show and as a comedian, so I was surprised and intrigued when his book was not comedy writing, but instead stories from his childhood growing up in South Africa. There's a comedic flair thrown in (he has a strong voice that stays consistent throughout), but it's not a humor book. 
 I loved how Trevor [sidenote: after reading this I feel like I can call him by his first name, like he's the kind of person I could meet in a bar and with we could share a great conversation] weaves his social commentary and observation in with his stories. I never comes across as preachy or didactic. Though his stories center around very intense things that have happened to him, he has no tones of self-pity or self-grandiose. Reading this book left me with a craving to learn more, to DO more. 
 I was at a 4/4.5 leading into the end...and then the last story blew me away. It literally gave me goosebumps, which hasn't happened to me since I read ""one hundred years of solitude"" as a teenager. That pushed me to a 5 star rating.

Instead of levelling on and on about the atrocities of apartheid, Noah tries constantly to present the small absurdities in his life while observing how they would relate to the wider national community. And in this right, I would argue, Noah succeeds far better in demonstrating the ineffectiveness of apartheid, because while concerted political efforts were what ultimately brought down such an odious system, it's the power of subverting the institution through laughter that a real victory is achieved. 
 If you can laugh at something, it's difficult to take it too seriously.

 Be still my multiracial heart. I never wanted this to end. I wish there was literature like this when I was growing up. I wish I had someone that could explain the complexity of being biracial to me. I've longed for it for so long, and now, when I finally got it, I was a teenager again, and I cried through the whole thing. 
 ""I wasn't popular, but I wasn't an outcast. I was everywhere with everybody, and at the same time I was all by myself."" 
 It is very very rare for me to find a book that I hold so close to my heart. Books that make me stop, think, read passages over and over and spend breathing days in between reading something meaningful to me, so that I not devour it all in one gulp. I stopped reading for days cause I didn't want it to end. I read books in between because I didn't want to finish it. 
 ""Ever the outsider, I created my own strange little world. I did it out of necessity. I needed a way to fit in."" 
 I doubt this is the general consensus, but for some it might me. Voices of generations of kids growing up in a world that has no place for them is so important. We all long to find a safe space to call our own, a place where we can be understood. I found that space in between the pages of Trevor Noah's book. 
 So many times tears fell and loudly had to exclaim YES! That's exactly how I feel! I read passages to friends and they all nodded in agreement that the text was practically describing me. And I am not even black or african or swiss. I'm Norwegian, Spanish, Filipino, Indian, Chinese. And yet, the words call out to me. How powerful is the new emerging tribe of half-breeds that their experiences can rise above race all together and be the same story far across the other side of the world. 
 Nelson Mandela once said, ""If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to hi in his language, that goes to his heart."" 
 So this was mostly my reaction to the book, and I may be biased. But the book, I though was also written very well, Mr.Noah is fantastic storyteller and he kept my attention and interest sharp throughout. I also learned a lot about apartheid and places in the world I have never been, reading about his childhood in South Africa. I think this book is an interesting read regardless if you know of him or not (which I barely did) and regardless what race you are, it's an interesting story. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes inconsistent, sometimes exciting. It shows a life. And a story of a life is always worth telling, and always worth reading. 
 I would definitely recommend this book to anyone biracial with interest in introspection. There is comfort in finding situations and people living a life similar to your own. I would also recommend this book to everyone else. The naivete of a child is something everyone should be able to relate to, and if you've ever crossed a few lines, I'm sure there's comfort for you in there too. If there's one thing Mr.Noah successfully showed me it's that it's ok to have a past, but we don't have to live there, we can move on to the future.","Wed May 31 05:07:00 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 16 13:39:13 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Wed May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 A few weeks ago, my boyfriend was going out for drinks with a friend at a local bookstore and cafe. I was invited, but am a total homebody and told him have fun, but bring me a book. He brought back Born a Crime and Neil Gaiman's new nonficton, The View from the Cheap Seats. Born a Crime was shorter, so I started that first. 
 Born a Crime is exclusively about Noah's life before he left South Africa, and it's largely about his life before he got into comedy--comedy is only mentioned a handful of times, at best. The majority of the book takes place during his childhood and teens, when he lived with his mother and, later, his stepfather and younger brother. During his early childhood, apartheid was still in effect in South Africa, and later on its effects were still being felt even after it was officially abolished. As a mixed-race child (black South African mother, white Swedish/German father) Noah was literally born a crime, and his anecdotes are about race, discrimination, and the fluidity of identity during apartheid and after. As a mostly basic white girl, these things were fascinating to read about, because it's a culture I will never be a part of, but something I dearly want to understand in order to be a more educated, worldly, and tolerant individual. 
 Floating around in the background of many of the anecdotes is Noah's home life, which practically vanishes from the page after his mother marries his stepfather. This lends a very strange dynamic to the book, because you can tell there's something to do with that, and abuse, floating around in the background, but it seems like Noah's avoiding it. Which is totally his right, if wants to, but it's a strange feel. Well, he's not avoiding it. He comes out with it all in the last chapter of the book, and I can see why. While much of the book has touching moments, that final chapter is definitely the one with the strongest emotional impact. It adds so much context that was missing in the rest of the book and makes a lot of things much clearer in hindsight. 
 Noah has an extremely readable style. While he's a comedian, this book is frequently poignant rather than laugh-out-loud funny, though a few of his signature jokes are in there--like how, during apartheid, he couldn't walk with his mother when police were around because mixed-race relationships were illegal, and when cops would appear she would drop him like a bag of weed so that they wouldn't be harassed. Each chapter is prefaced by a shorter section that says something about apartheid and how it affected and still affects the people in South Africa. He shows both how far South Africa has come, and how far it still has to go, in a variety of ways--from racial equality (not that the United States is exactly a beacon of excellence in this area) to things such as basic sanitation. But at the same time, he includes touching stories of his relationship with his mother (this book was infinitely better than Maya Angelou's Mom & Me & Mom in that regard) and of finding himself. It's a great book, an easy read but one that packs a punch at the same time in a lot of areas, and I highly recommend it.

For me, the goal of reading an autobiography is to learn about a person, to learn about their view on the world and preferably to learn from their experiences. It gives me the chance to (as cheesy as it sounds) widen my horizon and understand and tackle an important topic from a perspective I might not have known, or might not have the chance to gain all by myself. For example, Apartheid and with that racism as a whole is a topic that I know about and understand what it means. But, as a white caucasian woman, I'm fortunate enough never to have experienced racism on my own skin. So, by reading an autobiography by someone who actually experienced racism I can at least come close to grasp the full extent to which racism affects its victims. 
 The reason why 'Born A Crime' gets 5 stars, is simply because it's all I wish for in an autobiography. Before I read this book, I liked Trevor Noah. After I finished it, I had new respect for him. He doesn't only tell the story of his childhood, but he also gives a unique perspective on the world and especially on Apartheid/racism. I laughed with him, I cried with him, I felt with him, and all of that even though I absolutely cannot relate to (almost) all of the hardship he had to go through. And funnily enough, the secret hero of the book isn't Trevor Noah himself, but his mother. So, apart from every other reason why you should read this book, to everyone who loves to read about a strong, incredible woman, I recommend Trevor Noah's 'Born A Crime'.","Tue Jan 03 12:22:18 -0800 2017","Tue Jul 18 09:02:24 -0700 2017","","",9,0,"False"

But also what an unstoppable force his mother is. With a mother like her, it's no wonder he survived his childhood and can laugh about it now.

A half white, half black boy growing up in Apartheid and what happened after Apartheid was over. This story had me laughing, shocked and tears in my eyes during parts. His mother is such an admirable woman, taking whatever life threw at her and her family and making sure her son learned and grew from it. I hope to be at least half as great a mother as she is.

I think I learned more about apartheid, as well as the effects thereof on people's everyday lives and thoughts, than in any other book I've read before.

He does not write from a place of hate or self-pity. There is a lot of wisdom and insight in these short vignettes. As he is now the host of The Daily show, there is a lot of American comparisons, which I found very interesting, and which will help non South African readers have a better understanding of what he is describing.

Here was this comedian not many were familiar with, taking over one of the landmark shows on television. Threw many for a loop, that's for sure! In ""Born A Crime"", Noah takes the reader on a ride through his childhood in South Africa - from literally being a crime to be born, to being thrown out of a vehicle BY HIS MOTHER, to his life of petty crime. 
 This is not a book written by a comedian. Rather, it is a book written by a person who happens to be a comedian. Which is to say - it's not constant jokes and laugh-out-loud funny. There is humor here, some of the ""make a joke"" variety, and some simply in the circumstances in which he was raised. There is a lot of tragedy as well - and some pointed commentary about how and why ""the system"" doesn't work for far too many people. 
 I wasn't sure what to expect, really. Noah is a fairly unknown element, this is his first book, and he's a comedian writing a reasonably serious book. Basically, it could have gone very wrong - but it didn't. The stories are interesting and tend to tie together very well, the history of South Africa that is part of the book is eye-opening, and he writes as I would imagine he is in every day life...still joking, but able to be serious. Sort of like the cute guy next door who always has a smart-assed comment, but surprises you with his intelligence as well. The only thing I wasn't fond of was the ending - it did seem a bit abrupt.

 Enigmatic is a word I would add. This is not the story of Trevor Noah's rise to fame. Indeed, there's no clear connection from the stories he shares to where he is now. 
 I'm sure a great deal of the book was intended to be humorous and purposefully irreverent, but I read undercurrents of resentment and extreme selfishness. At some points there was incredible incongruity in the retelling. He writes that he felt (and still feels) no guilt for the enormous repercussions others faced for his actions (i.e. unemployment, homelessness and jail time).... when those others were Black South African domestic workers and their children. However, he then writes how guilt ridden he was when one of his buddies brought him a stolen digital camera to resell (as part of his regular hustle) with images of a white family vacationing. He actually went into detail about how that one thing, so insignificant compared to other stories he shared, had the power to make him evaluate the direction his life was going in. He was devastated by the thought of a well-off white family being robbed of their vacation photos... even as he sat on a corner in the Alexandra slums taking advantage of his fellow oppressed Black South African neighbors. That was difficult to read and hard to swallow. 
 Instances like this and others made it feel as if he were playing to an audience. Throughout the book, he played to several different audiences: Americans, Black Americans, the World, South Africa, white people. All large scale and somewhat large in scope with little to no intimacy. 
 That being said, Born a Crime is a good read. The pacing is consistent throughout. Noah's commentary on various cultural and societal norms as well as the history of South Africa is insightful and at some times, eye-opening. There's no real chronology to the stories, he actually jumps around quite a bit with no solid grasp of time period or age, but the stories flow well together. 
 Early on the book comes across as a loving tribute to his mother. He shared some beautiful moments and teachings from his mom. Towards the middle the underlying resentment becomes quite prominent. I got the sense that there's quite a bit he has yet to come to terms with, to accept or to forgive. He explains situations and rationalizes experiences but he doesn't really express any real understanding or empathy for the people he's writing about. Which is surprising, considering how he prefers to talk about his mother's courage and devotion to providing for and protecting her children. There are also stunning moments when he belittles his mother on the sly... while propping himself up. His intelligence. His speed. His independence. His logic and realism. Eventually, at a very young age, he became better than his mother. He doesn't explicitly say this, but it is implied throughout. Ironically, one of his biggest tributes to his mother is her insistence that he learn to think for himself, that he question authority and systems. It becomes evident that his critical thinking and questioning led to an internal rejection of his mother, her faith and cultural beliefs. Due to the way life flows, there is also hope that his thinking will bring him full circle to a wholesome appreciation for everything his mother is and represents. 
 Common Themes: 
 Church and faith: Christianity as a white man's religion. Trevor Noah appears to have equal low regard for the practice of Christianity and tribal mysticism. He writes a great deal about his mother's faith but nothing of his own. In this way he provides the scope of a panoramic image (mother, tribe, cultural history) without the intimacy of his details (is he a Christ believer, follower, practitioner?). 
 Critical thinking and breaking cycles of bondage: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah is a rebel with a cause. She didn't so much spend time questioning the systems and norms as much as figuring out how she could get around them to live her life on her terms. From an early age, she made decisions for her life and grew from the consequences and results of her decision. She was determined not to live in her mother's home on tribal homelands in obscure servitude as the second girl child in the family. She was even more determined not to raise children who were beholden to the past and the tribe. Her intelligence, her perseverance, her dexterity, her independence allowed her to venture where most Black people did not dare in apartheid South Africa. Bit by bit, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah carved out a space for herself in a world that was completely against her. Then she made room for her son, Trevor. Eventually, she enlarged that space to include her growing family. When I first read the below passage, I thought, ""Even if showing Trevor that the ghetto was not the world was all she had done, she would have indeed accomplished a great deal."" 
 People thought my mom was crazy. Ice rinks and drive-ins and suburbs, these things were izinto zabelungu - the things of white people. So many black people internalized the logic of apartheid and made it their own. Why teach a black child white things? Neighbors and relatives used to pester my mom. ""Why do all this? Why show him the world when he's never going to leave the ghetto?"" 
 ""Because,"" she would say, ""even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I've done enough."" 
 Ms. Noah, you've done a superb job! 
 Independence and outsider: Trevor Noah writes about being an outsider everywhere he went at each stage of life he shares about. Perhaps more from that feeling than his mom's teachings, he grew to be fiercely independent. It also seems clear that his fondest days were when it was just him and his mom. Before the family expanded and he became an outsider in his own home. In some instances it seems the idea of independence and being an outsider morphed to mean the same thing and become somewhat interchangeable in the retelling of his stories. 
 Power and impact of choice: At one point he writes: ""Nobody wants to be rich. People want to have choices. Money gives you choices."" Perhaps overall, he dissected his movement through the world as varying levels of opportunity and choice. On some level, he may truly believe that money equals choice and translates to power. Perhaps he thought as he took advantage of his opportunities he could create the power to choose his life as well. Ultimately, he has. However, the glaring power moves he made in Born a Crime were when he accepted the benefits of being mixed/colored/lighter skinned in black and white communities when doing so put other black people at a severe disadvantage and occasionally harm's way. 
 My mother used to tell me, ""I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return."" I was a product of her search for belonging. She never felt like she belonged anywhere. 
 Love, discipline and rebellion: Noah thinks his mother was too hard on him, but it seems like she let him get away with a lot just from exhaustion. In many ways he parallels his life with his mothers' life. Her quest for love and belonging became his. Her need to discipline him birthed his need to out-maneuver her and perhaps show her how little he needed her in general. On the flip side, he also viewed her rebellion as his natural inheritance. 
 Freedom: There is a strong cord of freedom flowing throughout the stories Trevor Noah shares. As a concept, reality, illusion, wish, hope... as something somehow always out of reach. A couple of times, regarding his own troubles and the poor Black South African community in general, Noah writes, ""They're free, they've been taught how to fish, but no one will give them a fishing rod."" At one point, he thanks someone from a privileged class for giving him a rod. The analogy has a false ring to it. Or perhaps it's simply incomplete. The poor, oppressed and disadvantaged people of the world are not incapable of enjoying their freedom because the lack the tools to nourish it. The poor, oppressed and disadvantaged people of the world are prevented from accessing resources (farmable lands, drinking water, washing water, bodies of water with fish, etc.). He actually writes about how the South African government purposefully removed groups of people from their tribal lands and forced them onto near barren lands and locked them in with walls and guns. When apartheid fell, the people pretty much stayed where they had been put for the last century, i.e. Soweto and Alexandra. The irony of looking to your oppressor for a handout is painful. The way around that is to exercise your freedom. Make your way to the resource you need and figure out how to nourish yourself with the tools on hand. Usually the only tools we have are our own two hands. However, necessity is the mother of invention. The poor, oppressed and disadvantage people of the world have been made to think that their better life is on the other side of a wall. In other words, that they need their oppressors. They don't. They only need access to resources that cannot be owned, but that men the world over continue to capitalize on and create barriers around. 
 Language and Communication: One of the most beautiful illustrations in Born a Crime, is Trevor Noah's use of language. He speaks several languages and learned at an early age that language, not skin color is the true indicator of belonging and community. When you speak a person's language you are able to speak to their heart (paraphrased). Even as he shared how he was able to switch from being an outsider to an insider by speaking the language of the group he was attempting to appear like or to infiltrate, he also showed how speaking the same language with no common understanding is as disastrous as speaking different languages while working towards the same goal. In some ways, Born a Crime is a micro study of how communication between and within groups can go awry and also how it can tie us all together.","Sun Mar 19 11:51:09 -0700 2017","Thu Mar 30 13:38:46 -0700 2017","Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

Before this novel, all I knew of Trevor Noah was that he was the new host of The Daily Show and that he was from South Africa. Now, consider me a true Trevor Noah fan for life. This book has nothing to do with Trevor's life in America, or his experiences as a Hollywood celebrity, or how he feels about American politics. Instead, it is a gripping memoir that nearly had me in tears several times, had me laughing out loud at other points, and had me knowing that I will remember this book for the rest of my life. I learned so much about South Africa, about institutional racism, and about human experiences that I will never have to face. If you decide to pick this book up, I highly recommend the audiobook.

 Favourite Quote: 
 My mother took me places black people never went. She refused to be bound by ridiculous ideas of what black people couldn't or shouldn't do. .... My mom raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid--not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered. 
 We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited. 
 Growing up in Soweto, our dream was to put another room on our house. Maybe have a driveway. Maybe, someday, a cast-iron gate at the end of the driveway. Because that is all we knew. But the highest rung of what's possible is far beyond the world you can see. My mother showed me what was possible. The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will. 
 Perhaps even more amazing is the fact that my mother started her little project, me, at a time when she could not have known that apartheid would end. There was no reason to think it would end; it had seen generations come and go. I was nearly six when Mandela was released, ten before democracy finally came, yet she was preparing me to live a life of freedom long before we knew freedom would exist. A hard life in the township or a trip to the colored orphanage were the far more likely options on the table. But we never lived that way. We only moved forward and we always moved fast, and by the time the law and everyone else came around we were already miles down the road, flying across the freeway in a bright-orange, piece-of-shit Volkswagen with the windows down and Jimmy Swaggart praising Jesus at the top of his lungs. 
 People thought my mom was crazy. Ice rinks and drive-ins and suburbs, these things were izinto zabelungu--the things of white people. 
 So many black people had internalized the logic of apartheid and made it their own. Why teach a black child white things? Neighbors and relatives used to pester my mom. ""Why do all this? Why show him the world when he's never going to leave the ghetto?"" Because,"" she would say, ""even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I've done enough","Wed May 10 17:10:32 -0700 2017","Wed May 10 17:42:49 -0700 2017","Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 -0800 2016",0,0,""

Trevor Noah writes about his childhood growing up ""colored"" in South Africa, which you will learn, as a reader to this book, how that is different from white or black or Indian. Despite studying apartheid in school (or so I thought) I had no clear concept of the complexity of the system, intentionally designed to put people at odds with one another. 
 Trevor Noah was quite a character, running from his mother and selling bootleg music. He has some deeper experiences such as an abusive stepfather, but most of the book is just about everyday life with the backdrop of the politics as they touched his life. 
 Of interest to me, while a minor element of the book, is some comparison between South Africa and other countries in the way they approached native populations, how they educate their current students on their past, and what lingers today.","Mon Jan 02 19:32:12 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 19 19:24:35 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 19 19:20:01 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 -0800 2017",53,0,"False"

 Throughout the book Mr. Noah's charisma and humour shines through his writing. He is frank about his many wrong doings as a youngster but relates the stories in such a way the reader is often laughing out loud at his pranks. 
 Trevor talks of his family openly, his obvious high regard for his mother even when she is chastising him shines through and gives a unique insight into the character of the woman who survived many harsh events while teaching her oldest son real life values that he needs to live by to be an upright citizen and human being. He talks about the abuses imposed on himself and his mother by a step father/husband and corrupt system, all of which taught him the kind of person he should never be. 
 I heartily recommend this book to anyone familiar with Trevor Noah as the very funny comedian that he is and also to anyone interested in how life was for the various factions of non whites during the unsettled times surrounding pre and post apartheid in South Africa.

When Jon Stewart retired from the show, I quit watching it regularly; although I have caught a few episodes during this election season and have been impressed with the new young host. So, I thought I'd give his new book a read. 
 I was surprised - it has absolutely nothing to do with his 'day' job as a comedian. The book does a great job of painting a chilling picture of life in South Africa both during and after apartheid. 
 ""In America you had the force removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happenign to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid. "" 
 ""What I do remember, and will never forget, is the violence that followed. The triumph of democracy over apartheid is sometimes called the Bloodless Revolution. It is called that because very little white blood was spilled. Black blood ran in the streets"". 
 Noah was/is smart... and spent time as a street hustler.. he observes ""As soon as things start going well for you in the hood, it's time to go. Because the hood will drag you back in. It will find a way."" 
 However, not all the villains in this book are white. His mother is the victim of horrific domestic abuse; and despite her attempts to file charges, the police do nothing. Even after shooting her in the head ... he spends no time in jail. It's appalling. 
 Yet, Noah resists the temptation to respond to violence with violence... this book doesn't get into his career, and how we went from the hood in Johannesburg to The Daily Show - hopefully we can read about that in his next book!","Fri Dec 23 21:00:50 -0800 2016","Fri Dec 23 21:14:13 -0800 2016","","",0,0,""

 Words cannot describe how much I love this book and yet here I am writing a review. You may know Trevor Noah as (to my knowledge) the most well-recognized African (South African to be exact) comedian or as the newish host of the satirical news program The Daily Show. Full disclosure, I love Noah's comedy style and his stand-up shows (at least the ones on Youtube and Netflix) as well as The Daily Show. However, even if his comedic style isn't your type this book is worth reading. 
 In Born a Crime, Noah weaves the story of his childhood and young adulthood with history and implications of Apartheid, and his mother's life. This book seems part autobiography and part history book. In other cases that combination may not work but for Noah and his story the reader must understand, at least on a basic level, Apartheid and how it shaped Noah's life. 
 I'm ashamed to say that before reading this book I didn't know much about apartheid. Yes, I knew what it was and that Nelson Mandela was instrumental in bringing it down but I had no idea how it worked. Noah explains that as a form of control over the black South Africans, white people divided, categorized and pitted the black South Africans against one another. The two main groups were: Zulu and Xhosa. Noah describes Apartheid as perfect racism. It was well studied and carefully implemented. Noah says it best: 
 ""In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid."" p. 20 
 This book gives a nice introduction to apartheid while simultaneously learning about the author's life. 
 Now, let me address the title. He was born to a black mother and white father: a crime. I had to take time and think about what that title meant. Noah describes some of the things he had to endure because he was not supposed to be born by apartheid standards, at least with the parents he had. I'm still struggling to wrap my mind around the concept. It's something that I, a white woman, cannot relate to in the least bit but it's important to learn and understand. 
 While I can't relate to the discrimination and ostracization Noah, and black South Africans more generally, faced I can relate to certain elements of his upbringing. The big one is the Christianity. Noah's mom was a devout Christian. Three different church services, at three different churches every Sunday, that's what Sunday held for the author. God and Jesus were the center of all decisions. This is something I can relate to. My parents were devote Christians and so were their children - in name at least. I won't say much more because his church experiences were so similar to mine and I don't want to give it away. Just read the book. (Sidenote: thankfully my parents aren't that.... let's say devoted anymore and haven't been for awhile). 
 The last thing I'd like to touch on is his mom. As much as this book is about Trevor Noah, it's just as much about his mom. At times, this book reads like a beautiful, heartbreaking ode to his mother. She worked her ass off and defied the odds. She went against the grain of what was expected of a woman but of a black South African woman. That translated into the way she raised her son. It's fascinating to read about their relationship because in the context of South Africa during and even after apartheid what she did was so unusual. She faced riots, sexism, domestic violence, and being shot in the face . There is no other word for her other than incredible, a powerful force. 
 So, with all of that being said, or written, please do yourself a favor and go read this book. You won't can't be disappointed.","Tue Jan 10 09:19:49 -0800 2017","Thu Mar 16 16:45:58 -0700 2017","Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 -0800 2017",20,6,"True"

The more so, when I myself was born in an ex-colonized country. There's a spirit in ex-colonized countries, as the author puts it, an 'aspiring to whiteness'. I love this paragraph, and how the perspective flips: 
 Colored people had it rough. Imagine: You've been brainwashed into believing that your blood is tainted. You've spent all your time assimilating and aspiring to whiteness. Then, just as you think you're closing in on the finish line, some fucking guy named Nelson Mandela comes along and flips the country on its head. Now the finish line is back where the starting line was, and the benchmark is black. Black is in charge. Black is beautiful. Black is powerful. For centuries colored people were told: Blacks are monkeys. Don't swing from the trees like them. Learn to walk upright like the white man. Then all of a sudden it's Planet of the Apes, and the monkeys have taken over. 
 The book is also about the author's relationship with his mother. In the very first chapter, he drops a bomb 'shot at the back of her head'. And we find out in the end what really happens. Faith plays a large part. Miracle too. It plays on our emotion (heartbreaking) as mother and son become distant and we see the whole futility of arguments. Every chapter has a twist, some kind of irony, sweet romance or luck (as his friend Andrew bequeathed him a CD writer and 'changed his life'). 
 There are so many quotable sentences and words of wisdom in this book that it is hard for me to choose. Born a crime makes me laugh, makes me think and reminds me of my own childhood living in poverty. 
 In Germany, no child finishes high school without learning about the Holocaust. Not just the facts of it but the how and the why and the gravity of it--what it means. As a result, Germans grow up appropriately aware and apologetic. British schools treat colonialism the same way, to an extent. Their children are taught the history of the Empire with a kind of disclaimer hanging over the whole thing. ""Well, that was shameful, now wasn't it?"" 
 In South Africa, the atrocities of apartheid have never been taught that way. We weren't taught judgment or shame. We were taught history the way it's taught in America. In America, the history of racism is taught like this: ""There was slavery and then there was Jim Crow and then there was Martin Luther King Jr. and now it's done."" It was the same for us. ""Apartheid was bad. Nelson Mandela was freed. Let's move on."" Facts, but not many, and never the emotional or moral dimension. It was as if the teachers, many of whom were white, had been given a mandate. ""Whatever you do, don't make the kids angry."" 
 The unemployment rate, technically speaking, was ""lower"" in South Africa during apartheid, which makes sense. There was slavery--that's how everyone was employed. When democracy came, everyone had to be paid a minimum wage. The cost of labor went up, and suddenly millions of people were out of work. 
 And I'll finish with the last quote, my favorite: 
 I don't regret anything I've ever done in life, any choice that I've made. But I'm consumed with regret for the things I didn't do, the choices I didn't make, the things I didn't say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. ""What if..."" ""If only..."" ""I wonder what would have..."" You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days. 
 I haven't picked a memoir for a long time, and can't regret picking this one.

In a series of essays, Trevor Noah details growing up in South Africa, from stories of rampant racism (Apartheid was still in place when he was born), to dating, to domestic abuse. Everything was told with an honest and frank assessment that made the story that much more touching and realistic. 
 Trevor Noah was born to a black mother and a white father during Apartheid, which was illegal. Despite knowing about Apartheid and its general horrors, I've never truly read about it, so listening to Trevor's story was both eye-opening and horrifying, such as when he and his mom couldn't be seen together in public because he was colored and she was black. Throughout the story, his mother was truly the amazing one. This woman didn't let other people's views and beliefs rule her life, although it saddens me to say that later in life she could not get out of the cycle of domestic abuse that women sometimes find themselves in. What amazed me even more was the police's treatment toward the husband, which was disgusting. 
 Trevor's memoir is one worth listening to. Not only is it a daily look into Apartheid and its impact on the people, but it's also an unique perspective in that he was colored and found himself torn between both part of him. It is also a story about the resilience of humans in the face of hardship and hopelessness. As the audiobook is narrated by Trevor Noah himself, I would highly recommend listening to the audiobook.","Wed Dec 14 08:35:39 -0800 2016","Wed Dec 14 08:35:58 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",1,0,""

I have a better understanding of a lot of things: Apartheid, culture, linguistics, tribalism, poverty, identity, identity politics... 
 Mainly Apartheid. 
 For many Americans, their understanding of Apartheid is this: there was a racist government in South Africa. It was set up by the British, or the Dutch - one of those racist imperial colonizing powers... They imprisoned Nelson Mandela for 27 years. They released him after international pressure and much singing. He became president, unified the country, and South Africa has lived happily every after ever since. 
 I wouldn't be surprised if for many Americans it's actually much less than that. 
 When Noah talks about Apartheid being intentionally set up as a racist government, it's jarring. The architects of Apartheid looked around at all racist governments throughout history and used what they could to gain and maintain power. A little from the Third Reich, a little from the British, American Slavery... It's weird to think of people being so callous to humanity. 
 But then I think of all those others... They didn't just... happen. The Holocaust had architects. Slavery had architects. Jim Crow. And though ""architect"" or ""designed"" may be too strong of a word for many of the famines that ravaged India while they were under British rule, they were certainly man-made. 
 Even today in America, we're living in cities designed by redlining, and the consequences of slavery are being passed down - even to the seventh generation. 
 Noah explains that the unsavory history of South Africa is taught in South Africa much in the same way that the unsavory bits of American history is taught in America - it happened, it's over, let's move on with things. 
 Contrast that to how Germany teaches about the Holocaust, or Japan teaches about the invasion of Manchuria. 
 Noah lays out what it was like to be born into a system where his very existence was a crime. Interracial relationships were illegal. (But of course they happened.) 
 And he got a glimpse into a variety of lives. The white life, the black life, the ""colored"" life. Race relations are complicated in America. But damn. To many people, he looked white, but he identified as black - and hung out with mainly the South African Black population. (Hence the deeper understanding of Dolezal...) But more than that, he was legally recognized as neither, but rather ""coloured"" by the South African government. 
 Humanity's key task is understanding how we relate to others. It's understanding them, or trying, and developing a better understanding of ourselves in the process. 
 With empathy and love, Noah exposes the most vile scoundrels of his life, and sometimes he's the one being exposed. We join him in the understanding he's developed, and appreciate how much he's learned about himself in the process.","Mon Apr 03 10:10:20 -0700 2017","Fri Apr 07 20:00:32 -0700 2017","Fri Apr 07 18:55:53 -0700 2017","Mon Apr 03 10:10:21 -0700 2017",6,1,"False"

Apartheid wasn't something I was ever really taught about, they would mention it briefly, but never really in depth. Great read. It really put things in perspective and made me feel very lucky!","Fri Jun 02 21:35:39 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 02 21:50:27 -0700 2017","Wed May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",1,0,""

Or if you've ever wanted to learn more about South Africa, but hate nonfiction, then read this. Or if you like autobiographies set against a historical background (the fall of Apartheid happened during his childhood) then read this. No history book or documentary can top firsthand experience. 
 If you want to find out more about his career, this is not the book for that information. At some point in the story, he is a rising comedy star, but he says it as a fact, not part of the story. This isn't a story about his career. This is a story about his childhood, his family (mainly his relationship with his mom), the complications of his race (half white, half black) and a story about South Africa. 
 This is now my 2nd favorite nonfiction I've ever read. It's more than just an autobiography of his childhood. There's a great deal of educational information here, things I wouldn't have bothered to learn in a dry old history book, but told in Noah's voice, it drew me in. Before each chapter is sort of a prologue to that chapter, over half of those contain historical fact and tidbits about the country, the other half contain facts and tidbits about Trevor, then he launches into the relevancy during the chapter. 
 But don't misunderstand me, this book is HILARIOUS as well as deep. He is a comedian after all. I laughed so hard several times, especially during ""Go Hitler."" There were times I started crying because I'm a big sap and some of the things he went through were horrible, and sound that much more horrible because of how he tells it. In a weird mix of intense and lighthearted.

Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle."" 
 This book is amazing. That is all. Go preorder it. 
 I was reading this on my Kindle app and was highlighting like crazy. Trevor Noah has been an outsider all his life. In South Africa under apartheid there were four racial categories - white, black, colored, and Indian. Colored people were the descendants of interracial relationships in the past. There was no category for 50/50 black/white children because it couldn't legally happen. He chose to identify as black because that's what his mother was but he wasn't accepted there either. 
 Growing up both defined by and outside of such a strict racial hierarchy sharpened his insights. 
 ""That is the curse of being black and poor, and it is a curse that follows you from generation to generation. My mother calls it ""the black tax."" Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring everyone behind you back up to zero."" 
 ""British racism said, ""If the monkey can walk like a man and talk like a man, then perhaps he is a man."" Afrikaner racism said, ""Why give a book to a monkey?"" 
 He talks about history when describing why having a friend named Hitler wasn't considered strange. 
 ""Every country thinks their history is the most important, and that's especially true in the West. But if black South Africans could go back in time and kill one person, Cecil Rhodes would come up before Hitler. If people in the Congo could go back in time and kill one person, Belgium's King Leopold would come way before Hitler. If Native Americans could go back in time and kill one person, it would probably be Christopher Columbus or Andrew Jackson."" 
 ""Holocaust victims count because Hitler counted them. Six million people killed. We can all look at that number and rightly be horrified. But when you read through the history of atrocities against Africans, there are no numbers, only guesses. It's harder to be horrified by a guess."" 
 This is the story of growing up illegally because his mother fought to make a place for him even before the fall of apartheid. She was a visionary. However, even after apartheid there wasn't a place for him to make a legal living as easily as it was to make an illegal one in the townships. He talks about the saying about teaching a man to fish vs giving him a fish. He points out that it doesn't work if you don't also help him get a fishing pole. 
 This isn't the story of how he became a comedian or how he ended up taking over for Jon Stewart as the host of The Daily Show. That all comes later. This is the story of the world that shaped him into the person he is today. It is funny. It is horrifying. It is necessary reading.

 After having read several reviews of Noah's book and being a fan of his Daily Show I decided to give this a shot. Due to his talent to mimic voices and accents very well I chose the audiobook, which is definitely the best way to get hold of this story, because he does a fabulous job with the narration. All the different languages spoken in South Africa, the people's accent and the intonation in their voices are best listeend to. It is likely that most of the story's charme is lost if one reads it. 
 The narration was definitely the best part of the story. The plot doesn't follow a chronological order which sometimes can be confusing when the jumps backwards and foreward don't seem to follow a specific pattern.

 Noah tells his story by jumping back and forth over his life, instead of telling it in narrative order. He seems to tell the framework of the story first--how his black mother met his white father, how having a mixed-race baby was punishable by imprisonment, and how the toddler Trevor had to meet his father in a public park in which all races could meet. 
 Noah doesn't make himself a saint in this book. He talks freely about his stealing, selling hijacked music, fights, and a week he spent in jail for driving a car with the wrong plates. 
 As the story develops, we are introduced to Noah's stepfather, Able, and his unpredictable, violent temper. His siblings are born much later in the story, and the casual mention (in the opening of his book) to his mother's being shot, is finally completed at the end of the book.

 Five Amazing Stars* 
 I'm was just so excited to read and learn more about the amazing life of comedian and tv celebrity, Trevor Noah. I have been so fascinated about his birth in South Africa and how he made his working life to now end up on such a popular tv series in New York today. Such a wonderful story I thoroughly enjoyed this story so much. 
 We learn of the incredible troubles of living in South Africa. A county dealing with apartheid. How it affected each and every region, how they fought and how basically they ended up divided. Then fighting began cause lung the slaughtering to kill so many. 
 They had to them fight so hard. It latest for so many years. Even when apartheid ended the fighting still never stopped. It was time now to move on. 
 Such an amazing book. So full of hope and love for his family and the people home in South Africa too. Such an emotional read and a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. A complete Winner!! 
 * I recommend this book to everyone!!","Wed Feb 22 05:41:14 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 23 04:13:37 -0800 2017","","",2,1,""

 I love Trevor Noah on The Daily Show - I think his social and political commentary is some of the best (hilarious, but one of the most cutting). I didn't really know much about his past, but I have always appreciated the perspective he brought to the table and his occasional references to sayings or events from his country of origin (South Africa). Pretty much in the world of late night comedy hosts, hilarious though they all are, any minority POV is something different/special. But I never really thought about it (Noah's history) beyond that. Well, this book gives so much information, much of which is hard (but necessary), to swallow. And it's an absolutely fascinating and entertaining read. 
 There are two main threads in this memoir. Partly, this is a collection of Noah's personal memories - events and moments that stuck out to him from childhood. Partly, this is a commentary on apartheid and racism, looking at it both specific to South Africa and commenting in a more general sense. The personal stories and real, touching, and (when appropriate) hilariously rendered. In a departure from the normal celebrity memoir topics, Noah does not talk at all about his rise as a comedian, how he actually got to where he is now, or his experiences as a mainstream and very popular figure. Instead, this book is exactly what the title claims ""Stories from a South African Childhood"" - which is refreshing. Noah shares scary stories (like jumping from a moving vehicle as a 9-year-old), hilarious stories (like shitting on the kitchen floor or the always amusing tales of dating blunders), personal and heartbreaking stories (like what his mother did with her life to give him opportunity or his stepfather's abuse and the threat to his mother's life as a culmination of that), insane stories (he burned down a house?! or their neighbor that tried to steal their dog), unbelievable stories (it was literally illegal for his parents to have him, since they were different races, and he could have been taken away from them at any time, if found out, because he was now a different race from both of them), and illustrative stories (like how he became a local pirated music ""kingpin"" and DJ). All of which are written with his characteristic style of straightforward, harsh truths with a soft-ish comedic edge. His life kept me on the edge of my seat and, more than once, made me yell ""what?!"" out loud - a number of his stories border on the ridiculous and for one person to have experienced it all...it's clear why he (or an agent) wanted his to turn it into a memoir. 
 Regarding the commentary on racism, it's handled flawlessly for a book like this. Between each of the chapters there is a little section with a comment on apartheid or other aspects of South African life that, concisely and clearly, demonstrated the insanities of apartheid (and racism in general) or illuminated key (sometimes funny) cultural differences. These were short and pointed, making you think and question, but not to the point where the enjoyability of the rest of the book is overshadowed. Essentially, these are the written versions of his late-night monologues, all focused on one topic. So good. Also, periodically throughout the book, there would be times in the middle of a story that Noah would stop and make a quick observation/explanation on how absurd some of the social constructs that made the experience what it was actually are. These were on anything from the universal way middle/high school friends communicate and set each other up with ""dates"" to the way the South African government took advantage of black South Africans' cultural differences in order to manipulate them into, essentially, keeping themselves down. There are also many other types of lessons, those that Noah pulls together himself and those that have come from his mother. He talks about the things like the oversight in the common adage ""give a man a fish and you'll feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you'll feed him for life"" - sure then he'll know how to fish, but if no one is willing to give him a rod, what good does that do? He talks about the necessity of perspective when speaking of human rights atrocities - the prevailing Western point of view that that the worst offender is obviously Hitler versus the completely overlooked experiences of people across the African continent throughout history. He talks about his mother's lessons that in order to be whatever you dream to be, you need to have enough experiences that you are not limited by the fact that you don't know how to dream any bigger. He talks about, as a colored (mixed) kid who didn't ever fully fit anywhere, sometimes it's easier to be an insider as an outsider than an outsider as an insider (your own ""people"" are harder on you, if you don't conform, that those you might consider ""other"" to yourself). 
 Although apartheid has officially ended, every reader should be able to see the parallels between the remaining prejudices and inequalities, born of years of law-enforced racism, in South Africa and in the United States. This parallel, the enduring need for so much effort in both places before the effects can truly be overcome, might be (as an American reader) the most important take-away. Between the humorous childhood misadventures and the poignant mother to son lessons and bond, there is a distinct, if subtle, call to action. The drama in this book is what makes it hard to put down, but the historical and moral education (I learned a lot) is what will hit home. You won't be able to come away from reading this without taking both with you. Sometimes laugh out loud funny and sometimes so brutally serious that it's hard to listen to, this memoir has a little bit of everything and I definitely recommend it. 
 **I listened to the audiobook version and, after looking at the print version, I highly recommend the audio. Noah's accents and pronunciations are (obviously) perfect. And I know I would have come nowhere close to them if I had been guessing at it in my head while reading. It's a much more immersive and authentic feel and, more so than any audiobook I've listened to in the past, I think that makes a significant different here. The only thing is that the book is so good - so funny and so dramatic - that there were times that I did not want to stop listening and get out of the car when I reached my destination...","Tue Sep 12 19:25:18 -0700 2017","Wed Oct 11 16:39:01 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 26 08:18:22 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 12 19:25:18 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 I expected this to be funny or a social indictment due to Noah's comedian profession, but instead it was very insightful and felt genuine. One of my favorite messages from the book is that ""teaching a man to fish"" only feeds him for a lifetime if you give him a fishing pole. He was given some computer equipment at 18 that allowed him opportunities that he would have never had despite his education and intelligence. Another message is that it is never too late to turn your life around and make better choices. He certainly had some wild years in his youth.

 There are plenty of funny stories about Trevor's childhood, and it's no Daily Show, but above all Born a Crime is an excellent introduction to all things South Africa. Even after visiting recently, I could never get a handle on how to explain the complexity of the country. Everyone in their own bubbles is a big problem. But Trevor Noah expertly maneuvers through different scenes--much of it due to his mixed background--and explains so much history with apartheid and the different tribes and the colored thing and life in the townships and life in the homeland and so on... Some through little lessons scattered about but mostly through his own personal tales which gives this sort of thing a lot of emotional weight as well as knowledge. 
 Another major theme of the book is that his mother is the main character, besides himself. What a woman. It is very sad what happens in the end, but even through the tragedy Trevor's positive perspective makes it somehow. He has a lot of heart. South Africa does of course have it's problems, yet after this book one has to be at least more empathetic. And maybe even optimistic in some way. In any case I am left with much newfound respect for Trevor Noah, after learning what he's been through.

I have seen his funny segment comparing Trump to an African dictator, but haven't seen much else of his (maybe nothing). As a result, I probably came to his memoir of his childhood growing up in South Africa, Born a Crime, from a different vantage than most readers (having only heard him interviewed on NPR). His memoir is sometimes funny, but if that's what you're looking for - I wasn't - you probably want to look elsewhere. 
 Noah's memoir is an often-insightful exploration of the relationship between a mother and son, love, domestic violence and physical abuse, racism and color in South Africa, the effects of poverty on the impoverished, and more. I have friends who are ""colored"" in South Africa who have in the past attempted to explain the color system and their place in it - and I didn't get it. It makes sense now - as much as their system makes sense. (When my friends visited last summer, they asked for Trump stickers so as to put their own government's problems in context.) Noah's descriptions of the decisions one might make when poor - from my perspective, desperately poor - explains why he and others flagrantly skirted the law (e.g., often because that was the only available option). 
 Noah named people, some of whom probably would have preferred to not be named. For example, his stepfather attempted to kill his mother, saying, ""You've stolen my life... You've taken everything away from me. Now I'm going to kill all of you (Loc. 4015). His mother was at risk before, but probably even more so now. Noah was as brutally honest about himself, describing a range of embarrassing behaviors and illegal acts, as well as smart and savvy ones. 
 Noah offered nuanced views of his world: You want to live in a world where someone is good or bad, where you either hate them or love them, but that's not how people are (Loc. 3868). He described the good in his abusive stepfather. He saw his mother's ""hidings"" as coming from a place of love (Loc. 3808). He allows his world to be as complicated as it is.

Yes, he is a comedian and the book is funny and the stories are presented in an entertaining way but I hope the format doesn't minimize what readers could learn from his experiences and insight. I really hope he writes another book with the rest of his story once he found success and I would also love to know more about his mother, who sounds unimaginably strong. 
 The very first paragraph reads, ""The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all."" I know we don't label it as such here but it sounded so familiar, like he could be talking about our country today. 
 I also had an ""Amen"" moment when he was talking about the missing link to the ever popular phrase ""give a man to fish and he'll eat for a day, teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime"". Mr. Noah makes the excellent point that it's not enough to teach someone to fish, you also have to provide them with the rod. People need resources to succeed (and it's not a handout to get the resources because they still have to make good use of them). It sounded so simple when he said it and that's an outlook I will definitely hang on to. 
 I laughed at his anecdote about getting detention every day for being late. ""The names of the kids with detention were announced at every assembly, and I was always one of them. Always. Every single day. It was a running joke. The prefect would say, ""Detentions for today..."" and I would stand up automatically. It was like the Oscars and I was Meryl Streep."" 
 A Few Quotes from the Book 
 ""[His mother was] estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations - I was born a crime."" 
 ""We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited.""

I haven't seen any of Trevor Noah's comedy, but I will definitely be checking him out after reading his memoir! Trevor is a great storyteller and he truly does have a great story to tell. Sometimes I don't find comedians funny in print, but Trevor's humour really came through in this memoir and made what could have been a heavy topic incredibly interesting and enjoyable. 
 I really liked the formatting of the book and how each chapter was prefaced with a bit of historical and cultural context . It was really interesting to learn about his experience growing up in post-apartheid South Africa and the identity struggles he faced growing up in a black family but being considered 'coloured' by the rest of society. 
 The most beautiful part of this book for me though was Trevor's relationship with his mom. His mother is an incredible woman and I really admired her spirit, tenacity, and unflinching faith. She went after the life she wanted and was an independent woman in a place where it wasn't easy to be one. The system worked against her, but nevertheless she persisted!","Fri Apr 07 11:48:26 -0700 2017","Mon May 15 10:01:43 -0700 2017","Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Fri Apr 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017",1,0,"False"

I loved every bloody minute and think that Trevor Noah is a goddamn genius. Clearly he is so, so smart. The way he tells the story, with all the different accents and the acting out of parts, I would recommend listening to this one, rather than reading it quietly. 
 Trevor Noah paints the picture of growing up in Apartheid South Africa in a way that is at once so sad and heartbreaking, yet at the same time funny and rich and full of wisdom. 
 The story of his ""matrix"" dance date will make your heart fall out of your chest cavity. 
 You can only get this kind of three-dimensional, global, compassionate, earthy wisdom from real people with real life experience. I cannot say enough how good this book is.

And like the title, the fact that Noah was born to a black mother and a white father was punishable by five years in prison under the existing system. Even when apartheid ended and Nelson Mandela took over as president, many of the old structures remained, and it was difficult to live and survive in that system. 
 South African culture divided--and continues to divide--its races into four distinct groups: whites, blacks, Indians and coloreds. Under apartheid it was law that you were required to socialize only within your group, and whole communities--neighborhoods and even cities--were built to handle a particular group. Coloreds were traditionally people of mixed descent, and could be those with blended parents, or those whose ancestry was colored. What makes it even more complicated is that judges can rule a child colored, black, or even white, regardless of what their parents look like. Then his or her parents have to decide whether they both have to move to a different community, or separate so one will go with the child. 
 It's a totally different way of looking at race, and the apartheid rulers looked at how race was handled in many places--the United States, England, and other countries--before they came up with their structure. And it's an interesting part of the book. But it's not all of the book. Much of the story has to do with Noah's childhood being raised by a very strong, church-going mother. It's filled with humorous and interesting anecdotes, such as the time he and his dance troupe took their lead dancer named Hitler to a Jewish party, the time he spent a week in jail and what he learned, and his senior prom with the most gorgeous girl he had ever met that didn't speak a word of English. 
 It's a well-written book (at first I was sure it was ghost written and kept checking, but Noah apparently wrote it) and truly entertaining. I encourage you to get a copy.","Sun Feb 26 06:55:19 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 26 06:56:13 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 Some of the stories work better than others. 
 After reading this book, I have to say that I came away from it with a great deal of respect for his mother Patricia.

Instead, she got a job in an office in Capetown where she met a Swiss businessman who became her friend, and later the father of her first son. 
 She was a very strong woman who found her own way in life, despite the rules and expectations of those around her, both black and white.

 Trevor Noah's life was hard and tragic mostly. Not only he could not be seen with his parents in public (without devising special ways to make them look like they have a different relationship), he also grown up very poor. He was always the ""outsider"", not belonging to the white, the black, the Indians or the colored. But instead of feeling left out, he became a chameleon, with the ability to speak multiple languages and to make people laugh. He was mostly liked. In one of the stories, he get to know the ""black Hulk"" and he escaped being robbed because he's a polyglot. It was very amazing how he managed to use his skills for comedy to make light of his situation and being able to move on from the pain and trauma. 
 This book's main character at times seemed to be his mother. The rebellious, independent feminist was inspirational. It seemed like Noah's comedy out of tragic seemed to come from his mom, who joked that now Noah is the best looking person in the family because she got shot in the face!

 I picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting and entertaining story of how Trevor Noah traveled from South Africa to the world of stand-up comedy and political commentary. It was that, but also more. In these days in which racism seems to be accepted in this country by some, we need this reminder of how wrong that attitude is. The undercurrent through these stories of navigating first crushes and poverty and parental discipline and cultural issues is racism's insidious evil.","Mon Jan 09 06:43:44 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 09 06:44:57 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",0,0,""

I am not of that generation. I am of the generation who still remembers The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn. I am of the generation who was skeptical of Jon Stewart taking over (who could replace Kilborn?). I am of the generation who then watched the entirety of the Jon Stewart years and loved and respected him and came to believe that no one ever could replace him (who could possibly replace Jon Stewart). I say this because the truth is I've never really given Trevor Noah much of a chance. He seemed young and less political, more jovial, and, dare I admit it, a little too cool for me. He seemed to lack the experience and gravitas I'd come to expect from The Daily Show. And for no good reason, based on nothing but these assumptions (and also because I go to bed really early) I stopped watching The Daily Show. 
 I read his memoir because it was given to me, not because I sought it out, and in retrospect I both feel really bad about that and am really grateful it did find its way to me. Noah has a witty sense of humor, a solid comedic timing and an inherent likeability to him. But it's the wealth of experience and insight that makes this such a compelling read. Noah's stories focus on his childhood. They are at times humorous (the Go Hitler bit will kill you), at times painful, and in general paint a clear picture of life in South Africa during and following the end of apartheid. It is a memoir of poverty of an awkward teenager, of family dynamics, and race relations in South Africa. And it is, overall, something of a long love letter to his mother - an incredibly strong, independent woman who defied much of the rules and restrictions placed on her, and whom Noah clearly holds in the highest esteem. 
 It is certainly one of the most enjoyable memoirs I have read up late, and I humbly apologize for my earlier doubts of him. I have a new found respect for Trevor Noah. So much so I would gladly start watching The Daily Show again. Except, sadly, I still go to bed really early.","Mon Jan 30 07:41:41 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 30 08:05:46 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 -0800 2017","",0,0,""

One of the stories (the dance off) had me laughing so loudly in public, I turned more than a few heads. I would HIGHLY recommend the audiobook version as it is performed by Mr. Noah. As a native English speaker, the nuances of the diverse tribal languages are accessible in the audio format.

Not a typical celebrity autobiography, but a beautifully written, heartbreaking yet joyous, compelling story of growing up ""coloured"" (!Xhosa mother and Swiss father) in apartheid South Africa, and growing up with an abusive step father. His reflections on these issues are insightful, powerful and brilliant. 
 ""In any society built on institutionalized racism, race mixing doesn't merely challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and incoherent. Race mixing proves that taxes can mix, and in a lot of cases want to mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system, race mixing becomes a crime worse than treason."" 
 His mother is a powerful woman, and the book reads much like an homage to her. Not a perfect woman, but a strong, Jesus loving, hardworking woman who understands the world. ""The world doesn't love you. If the police get you, the police don't love you. When I beat you, I'm trying to save you. When they beat you, they're trying to kill you."" Later Trevor talks about the police responding to his mother's repeated calls for help after being beaten by her husband (who would later shoot her in the head)- and their complete lack of concern or help. ""That's when I realized the police were not who I thought they were. They were men first. Police second."" 
 I could quote the entire book - he touches on so many important subjects - racism, brutality, poverty, love, abuse... ""people love to say, 'give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.' What they don't say is ""and it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod."" He comes back to this analogy again- the importance of having the fishing rod is too often ignored. 
 ""You want to live in a world where someone is good or bad. Where you either hate them or love them. But that's not how people are."" 
 The book overall has a light, comedic feeling even though he is dealing with painful subjects. His wit shines through. He talks about his grandmother being afraid to hit him - when you hit black children they stay black- when you hit white children, they turn red and blue and green. 
 You should really listen to the book. You not only get Noah's comedic timing - you get to hear the multiple languages spoken by Noah. Absolutely beautiful.

As he points out, the Chinese in South Africa were categorized as black simply because there were too few of them to create their own category like the Indians. The Japanese, in contrast, were categorized as white because South Africans wanted to establish good relations to sell them luxury goods in their homeland. Noah imagines the struggle of the South African apartheid-era cop spotting an Asian: ""Hey, get off of that bench, you Chinaman!"" ""Excuse me, I'm Japanese."" ""Oh, I apologize, sir. I didn't mean to be racist. Have a lovely afternoon."" 
 As with all racist systems, the distinctions are arbitrary nonsense meant to strengthen divisions. Noah is considered colored in South Africa but has no connection with them since his parents aren't colored. Even after the end of apartheid, he struggles to find his group. Each time he changes schools, he has to negotiate where he will be accepted and fit in. At one school, they fast track him academically with the whites but he feels isolated. When he asks to transfer to classes with black students, where he feels a kinship, he's told he's ruining his future by aligning with the ""wrong"" group. He writes of colored people being officially promoted to white because of lighter skin tone and of whites being demoted to colored because their skin tans too easily. Never is your place in the racial hierarchy secure. 
 Noah does not detail his path to comedy success yet you get the sense that his outsider status gave him more acute observational skills fueling his comedic sense of absurdity. The ""Go Hitler! Go Hitler!"" diversity dance at the Jewish school is a brilliant and hilarious clash of oppression one-upmanship. His irate Pedi-speaking stunner of a prom date showed him where he was oblivious. He's also the ultimate survivor from being thrown from a moving car to supporting the miraculous survival of his mother, shot in the head by her abusive ex-husband. You get the sense that he's seen it all before, making him the perfect host to observe and comment on our current political insanity.","Sun May 21 19:52:05 -0700 2017","Sun May 21 20:00:29 -0700 2017","Tue May 16 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",1,0,""

 I listened to the audiobook version of this, narrated by Trevor himself. I think it's totally worth it, if you like audiobooks at all, to go for the audio over the printed copy. (I think it's almost always worth it to go for the audio of a biography if it's read by the author, so long as the author has stage/audio/acting credibility to their name.) 
 Listening to it from Trevor's voice made it *amazing*. We already know him, we recognise his voice, his intonation, how he'll be setting something up for a joke, and therefore we get all the anticipation to go along with it. It sounded conversational and intimate at times, like he was telling you a story at the same time as he was figuring out his own mind on the issue. Mostly, it was worth it because he wasn't ashamed to not show emotion in his voice. There was at least one time when I could tell he was near tears with what he was reading - the book tells you cried while writing it, but it's extremely moving to hear someone's vulnerability like that. 
 The story itself is worth it. It's a broad view of South Africa over the last 30 years, as seen by someone who was pulled from one view to another as they grew up. He's also got an outside perspective (he's used to explaining things to foreigners), so he doesn't drop us into things without context and explanation, which I think it really helpful. 
 But mostly it's personal, and intimate, and ridiculously interesting. OMG, his life, man, his life.","Thu Aug 17 17:56:12 -0700 2017","Tue Aug 22 09:56:22 -0700 2017","Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,"True"

Acerbic and witty, he gives us the intelligence to look at world news with a skeptical eye with the added bonus of being able to find the humor in it. 
 In Trevor Noah's first memoir book, Born a Crime, we get to see what it was like to grow up in South Africa during and just after Apartheid. Born to a white Swiss man and a Xlosa Black woman, Noah's birth was considered illegal in 1984, as a child of mixed race was a crime. He uses the book to point out the irony of the laws in place at the time of his birth, as well as what it was like to not quite fit into any one group. He had to end up becoming a sort of chameleon of sorts, sliding between groups speaking one language or another, but never really fitting into any sort of niche. 
 We learn of his childhood, where his mother tried to expose him to every opportunity she couldn't have, how deeply religious she was and how he saw things a little differently than she did how it didn't matter. We learn of how he overcame poverty and abuse, and his position as a person of mixed race to learn and grow. We also get insight into his ability to get himself into trouble, and how he eventually learned how to avoid it. 
 The book reads very similar to how he speaks; as I understand it, he also did the audio version of this himself, which makes me wonder how much of it was written before the audio version was done, or if he did the audio version first and then had it transcribed into the written form. Either way, the formula worked for his tale, and leaves the reader in anticipation for more. We only get up to as far as when his early comedy career took off, so there is room for more story later on. We get doses of the history of South Africa at the beginning of chapters, from the early laws from Apartheid to post-Apartheid South Africa; this is an area where I had little knowledge but the book is enlightening and engaging. 
 My rating? four out of five stars. Trevor Noah's attempts to give us a glimpse into how he evolved into the man he is now are awkwardly laid out in the book, but the story flows. The current host of The Daily Show's voice can be heard mentally as you read through this memoir of his early years, as it is written like he speaks: eloquently and intelligently. The stories of pure horror are intermixed with some light-hearted moments, giving us all a sense of how this man can find humor in even the most disturbing of scenarios.","Tue Jan 03 08:03:42 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 08 12:53:05 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

 Oh this book. This is my first ever autobiography and I could not have chosen a better book to read. First of all let me tell you that I just love Trevor Noah, I think he's doing a fantastic job as The Daily Show host and he's simply hilarious. If you've seen any of his stand up acts then you know how often he mentions apartheid and his parents, so going in, I had a pretty good idea of how deep this book would go. And then I was proven wrong. If possible, Noah went even deeper than I ever thought possible. He made me feel like I was just another part of his family, watching his life unfold before my eyes. The apartheid, the racism, his relationship with his mother - I just want to hug her, I can't - his relationship with his father and later in life his relationship with his friends, and school, and everything, really. 
 Reading Born a Crime was like having him next to me, speaking, like we were having a chat like friends. I actually felt like I was his friend and he was telling me his life's story. Noah being the amazing comedian that he is made me laugh so much with this, it balanced out the darker parts and those moments that made me go ohh hell dude. I don't really know how to rate a memoir, this is not fiction, this is the raw, hard truth, from someone that lived through these situations and he's sharing them with us. This book - apart from the engaging writing - delivers some pretty on point messages, countless in fact, that made me pause and nod along in agreement, I just loved how powerful it was and how unapologetic.","Sun Sep 18 03:34:36 -0700 2016","Mon Oct 24 09:58:53 -0700 2016","Mon Oct 24 10:07:34 -0700 2016","Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 -0700 2016",2,0,"False"

Trevor is definitely not the best writer when it comes to prose and character development(his characters are not well rounded so to say), but heck, can he be real. I particularly enjoyed how he addressed the issue about race- something that not many people do not [unfortunately] talk about at this day and age. Why has being black lost its value?

I wasn't initially sure what to expect from Stewart's replacement, but to be fair I wasn't really a die-hard follower of the show in the first place. Sure, I enjoy Stewart and his humor, but I wouldn't be completely lost if I didn't watch every episode or even every day; I typically only even watched occasional clips online. Needless to say, when Noah took over I started watching more; more often and more regularly. His humor, his perspective, and his voice are precisely what we need today. Thus, when I learned that he was releasing a book, especially a memoir, I just knew that I needed to read it. I was not, by any means, disappointed. 
 Before Noah's voice even appears on the pages, there are three highly notable things worth mentioning about this book: 1. There is a picture of young Trevor with his mother right on the title page, 2. His dedication: ""For my mother. My first fan. Thank you for making me a man,"" and 3. The Immorality Act of 1927. The weight of these three elements sets the tone for the book and, in retrospect, appropriately balances his attention to subject matter. His life with his mother, and even his mother alone, are by far incredibly prominent focal points for Noah's essays. The very nature of his existence, as technically a crime under the Immorality Act, is also a major factor as it dictated how he and his parents could interact in a society rife with such prejudices and, let's be honest, flat-out racism, as was the case in apartheid era South Africa. Each move he and his family made had to be precisely calculated. In many ways, there are incredible, and incredibly heartbreaking in every sense of the word and its meaning, parallels to the black experience here in America, especially in poor, underprivileged areas. Noah's reflections on his own poverty (at one time being so poor that he and his family slept in cars at his stepfather's workshop and ate worms) really provide a much needed perspective that everyone can and should appreciate. 
 Trevor Noah is also known for his comedy, so while there are definitely very serious and even scary (especially regarding his stepfather, Abel) stories between these pages, there are also some really hilarious aspects, too. Trevor generally seems like a guy who had a happy childhood (thank you, Patricia Noah) and was, quite frankly, a bit of a clown. I enjoyed the back and forth between him and his mother, especially when he tries to reason with her for getting out of going to church (a whole day ordeal, schlepping between three different churches: black church, white church, and mixed church; I can't say I blame the kid). I actually found that while I enjoyed this book in its entirety, I particularly and especially enjoyed any and every story involving his mother, Patricia. I became so invested in this strong, beautiful woman, that I almost skipped ahead to the last chapter (essentially an ode to her) to read over and over again. I remained patient, however I still have the urge to reread this chapter. Trevor's love and appreciation for, and dedication to, his mother is clear throughout this book, even in his reflections of tense, painful situations (e.g. cutting her out of his life when she becomes pregnant with Abel's second son). Her resilience and strength give me hope and strength by extension. 
 'You're lucky to be alive,' I told her. 'I still can't believe you didn't have any health insurance.' 
 'Oh, but I do have insurance,' she said. 
 'You do?' 
 'Yes. Jesus.' 
 'Jesus is your health insurance?' 
 'If God is with me, who can be against me?' 
 'Okay, Mom.' 
 'Trevor, I prayed. I told you I prayed. I don't pray for nothing.' 
 'You know,' I said, 'for once I cannot argue with you. The gun, the bullets--I can't explain any of it. So I'll give you that much.' Then I couldn't resist teasing her with one last little jab. 'But where was your Jesus to pay your hospital bill, hmm? I know for a fact that He didn't pay that.' 
 She smiled and said, 'You're right. He didn't. But He blessed me with the son who did.' 
 Though we grew up in vastly different worlds and with vastly different experiences, I found so many common traits with Trevor: 
 I didn't have any friends. I didn't know any kids besides my cousins. I wasn't a lonely kid--I was good at being alone. I'd read books, play with the toy that I had, make up imaginary worlds. I lived inside my head. I still live inside my head. To this day you can leave me alone for hours and I'm perfectly happy entertaining myself. I have to remember to be with people. 
 Okay, so the above relates in large part to the fact that he often couldn't go out, especially in certain neighborhoods, because of the color of his skin: he was always considered either too white or not black, never just Trevor. I understand the lone nature, though; as an introvert, this has always been my general state of being. Being alone is not being lonely and it's perfectly cool to be content with entertaining yourself, especially when books are involved... 
 My books were my prized possessions. I had a bookshelf where I put them, and I was so proud of it. I loved my books and kept them in pristine condition. I read them over and over, but I did not bend the pages or the spines. I treasured every single one. As I grew older I started buying my own books. I loved fantasy, loved to get lost in worlds that didn't exist. I remember there was some book about white boys who solved mysteries or some shit. I had no time for that. Give me Roald Dahl. James and the Giant Peach, The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. That was my fix. 
 As a librarian and general bibliophile, I fell in love with the above quote. As an anthropology minor (undergrad) and ever hopeful (future) linguistic anthropologist, I found Noah's comments on the power of language to be really inspiring and meaningful. 
 Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says 'We're the same.' A language barrier says 'We're different.' The architects of apartheid understood this. Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were separated not just physically but by language as well...The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite: convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it's easily tricked. 
 Nelson Mandela once said, 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.' He was so right. When you make the effort to speak someone else's language, even if it's just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, 'I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being.' 
 Trevor Noah is a polyglot, a necessary trait he developed while growing up in South Africa, where people were separated for so many stupid reasons (because, yes, racism is stupid) including language (aka tribe). By learning so many different languages, Noah was able to fluidly navigate difficult social situations as well as establish friendships, avoid being mugged (or worse), and understand others' cultural identity. We could all learn at least a little bit, if not more, from Noah's examples, especially here. 
 I highly recommend this book to everyone, regardless of your familiarity with Trevor Noah. I also recommend reading this book simultaneously with (or before/after reading) the YA book The Hate U Give for some beautiful/heartbreaking parallels (both with some much needed humor!) as well as important perspective into the black experience in America, especially today.","Thu Dec 08 09:32:48 -0800 2016","Tue Mar 14 15:02:35 -0700 2017","Fri Mar 10 11:54:53 -0800 2017","Thu Feb 02 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

The Queen of England shits. When we shit we forget how famous or rich we are. All of that goes away. 
 Trevor Noah has the perfect blend of politics, insight, and funny. That quote up there is a perfect view of that. It's funny--he's discussing the act of pooping. By default, it is toilet humor. But then he brings you around to this magical idea about how poop is the ultimate level playing field. You make six figures a year? You still shit, and you still have to wipe your ass. 
 He brought this kind of funny thinking process to every essay in this book. His mother pushing him out of a car. Being a criminal (insofar as creating pirated discs). Being adrift in a sea of black and white, and not quite belonging to each. Plus, it's totally worth reading just so you have Trevor Noah's voice in your head.

Noah is at his best recounting stories from childhood, where his vocal interpretations make the banter between school kids especially enjoyable. He has brilliant moments - describing defiling his grandmother's house, cheering his friend 'Hitler' obliviously - and poignant ones - taking a girl to prom who was so beautiful that he hadn't bothered to talk to her. Noah communicates the complex web of cultures, languages, and race that Apartheid South Africa stewed up, which I appreciated as someone with limited understanding of that time and place.

First of all, if you have watched ""The Daily Show"" which he took over from Jon Stewart a while ago, you'll hear his voice in every sentence. His writing has that kind of authenticity. It bubbles over with excitement and good humor, and at the same time it's penetrating in the accuracy of its psychological and social observation. 
 To have been ""Born a Crime"" was of course a literal truth for a bi-racial child in his native apartheid South Africa. Deprived of more than fleeting contact with a Swiss father, Noah was brought up by a fiercely loving and tenacious mother, who spared him neither the beating when she thought he deserved it, nor the often biting wisdom of her tongue. From his early years, he made fun of the Christianity to which she was devoted, but learned from her the ethical compass that saw him through even a mischievously rebellious--and at times moderately criminal youth. 
 Noah earned his smarts the hard way: on the back streets of Johannesburg's black townships, where survival was a matter of learning to negotiate the constantly shifting shoals of social, racial and political turmoil. Coming of age at the moment when apartheid was finally crushed by a mix of internal and international pressures, and always an outsider--not white, not ""colored,"" not Indian, and never accepted as completely black--he slipped cheekily between racial barriers by guile, deception and duplicity, making sure that he always, improbably, came out ahead of the game. Well, usually. There are times he described being slapped down brutally. But he has the native ability to bounce back up every time he gets knocked down. 
 If Noah takes us on an often riotous journey, it's one that is also often profoundly moving. Little short of a miracle that he survived a brutally abusive stepfather, a peripatetic education that combined the disciplined experience of Catholic school with the chaos of the streets, and his own unruly spirit that rejected every social norm, to become the sharp-witted, unsparing social critic that he is today. If you want to understand where his peculiar brand of satire comes from, this is a good place to start.","Thu Sep 28 15:17:17 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 28 15:19:17 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 28 15:19:18 -0700 2017","",1,0,""

 Noah paints a vivid picture of what it was like to be born as a a mixed child during apartheid. He discusses the implications that his mixed status imposed upon his own identity but also how it resulted in others groups not being able to fully accept him. He wasn't black enough for the blacks, or white enough for the whites, and he definitely did not identify as coloured. Subsequently, he experienced substantial amounts of isolation throughout his life. 
 Although the story of his early childhood is fascinating, the book is made that much more interesting through the parallels that Noah draws between the US and South Africa. He details how the South African government studied the racist policies and discriminatory initiatives of the British, German, and Americans and then developed the most perfect system of racism. Moreover, he warns the world of the age old truism: a people divided are easy to conquer.","Thu Dec 08 14:01:46 -0800 2016","Wed Dec 21 04:48:25 -0800 2016","Wed Dec 21 04:48:25 -0800 2016","Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

I also wasn't a huge fan of the way the narrative jumped around, at one point he's 20 and you think you're about to read how he started his career but suddenly he's 10 years old again and then 25.

 I'll preface this by saying that reading books has been by hobby, pastime, passion- you get the point. So naturally, I have read innumerable books. Many have moved me, mostly with laughter and happiness. About 3 have ever made me tear up, and 2 of those are Harry Potter books. 
 This book was beautifully crafted, compelling you with Trevor's life, the history of South African apartheid, his incredibly humorous narration, and his strange ability to neither dismiss the hardships he talked of, nor elaborate on them long enough for them to hurt deeply: but always just enough to pierce your heart before a light quip made you chuckle. 
 Yet, I surprised by self by bursting into tears- actually more like sobs- where Patricia, kind, beautiful, fierce, unstoppable Patricia, Trevor's mother, was shot. To me, it was a bioaccumulation of all the seeds of injustice sewn throughout the novel. Moments later, following Trevor's own emotional trajectory, I was half laughing through the tears, in awe at his mothers ability to crack jokes at a time such as that, in a world such as this. 
 This book teaches you that perspective and earnestness are everything. You can make the most of any time, place, and financial status so long as you are the special kinds of people who, like Trevor and his mother, never seem to lose the practical idealism of the good that life will give, if you knock hard enough and believe sincerely enough.","Mon Dec 05 00:08:19 -0800 2016","Wed Mar 08 10:06:35 -0800 2017","Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",1,0,""

I have always been a fan of Trevor Noah, since he replaced John Stewart on ""The Daily Show that is. However, I didn't know anything about his life. I only knew that he was funny and had the same political views as me. This book was one of the most enlightening things I have ever read. I learned so much from it. Especially when it came to the intense and unjust details of Apartheid in South Africa, as well as the affects it had on black people, Indian people, Colored people, even Asians (which I never even knew existed in South Africa at the time of Apartheid.) This book also gave me insight on why people from ""the hood,"" usually never make it out of the hood. As well as the reason poor people, can't simply ""pick themselves up from their boot straps"" and make a better life for themselves, simply because they lack the knowledge and resources to do so. I am very privileged, I've never been in a situation where I was afraid someone would come and take my Mother, or was afraid my step father would hit/shoot my mother. These fears I could never imagine coming true, were regulated and part of the norm in most towns of South Africa. I feel much more knowledgable and educated now that I have finished this book. Not to mention grateful of my situation and status. Especially considering I am no different than a ""colored girl"" from Africa that grew up during that time. The only difference between us would be the circumstances we were born into. She was born a crime, I wasn't. I don't know if that makes me feel blessed, or terribly sad.

When this former criminal turned comedian was given the job as host of the prestigious The Daily Show in New York, South Africans were bursting with pride. 
 But Noah's rise to fame had humble beginnings. The title of his bestselling autobiography refers to his parentage: a black mother and white father. Interracial relationships were forbidden under the racist apartheid regime and so, his very existence was a crime. With wit, irony and wry humour, Noah describes how his mother had to pretend she was his nanny because he was lighter than her. As a child, Noah was not allowed to leave the house, for fear that someone who questioned why such a light-skinned child was around black people. That didn't prevent his clever escapes, however. 
 From being a rascal as a child to a criminal teenager and finally, a comedian headed for stardom, Noah's story is a tragi-comedy. The book is also about his relationship with his mother, a fearless woman who was determined that her son would succeed, even as she battled poverty and domestic abuse. 
 Trevor Noah's book made me laugh out loud in one chapter, just to reduce me to tears in the next.

From the very start of this book, he gets your attention, the words starts talking to you. When you read the book you actually hear him in your head narrating his life story thats how good a storyteller he is.The story of a coloured kid being raised by a black woman in Africa during turbulent times. It's an adventurous, fun filled at the same time challenging life story of a mischievous(this would be an understatement) kid and his rebellious mother during apartheid.It is dramatic, inspiring ,emotional, thought provoking and hilarious all at the same time.Definitely worth a read.","Fri Feb 03 03:33:52 -0800 2017","Tue May 09 01:54:00 -0700 2017","Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",0,0,""

 Exceeded my expectations. Really. I learned so much about South Africa, apartheid, and race relations. Thank you!","Mon Feb 20 20:30:07 -0800 2017","Tue Feb 21 21:43:23 -0800 2017","Wed Feb 22 21:43:23 -0800 2017","Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""
