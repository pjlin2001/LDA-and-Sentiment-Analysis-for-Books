 I was surprised to find out that this book had multiple povs, not just August (a.k.a. Auggie, our protagonist and main character). Those other povs turned out to be my favorite part of the book. It was a very clever addition that worked out because the other povs give us insight in how other people perceive August's facial deformities. It works so well because the author was spot on in her characterization of the characters. Their thoughts and their actions were 100% accurate/realistic and completely reflect how kids (and even adults) would act or think. Honestly, reading this transported me back to when I was in elementary school and I honestly emphasize so much. I was definitely one of those kids who didn't partake in bullying but I wouldn't stand up for the person either (I'm ashamed to say). 
 Kids and adults alike will enjoy this book and the message resonates no matter how old one may be. Everyone should be reminded of the message of this book and I genuinely think if I ever have a child/children I'm going to give them this book to read. I honestly teared up like twice throughout this book, but I'm a big sap, so. 
 Also, the book I was reading had an extra ""Julian"" chapter and while I think it was a nice touch it wasn't as resonating or good as the main book imo, but maybe I'm being too harsh.","Tue Jan 01 17:37:26 -0800 2013","Sun Oct 02 14:05:25 -0700 2016","Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Sun Nov 29 00:00:00 -0800 2015",1,0,"False"

 I knew this was a book about a boy with a facial abnormality, but I didn't really know what else to expect. I was surprised by the several POV's and the wonderful story of a boy and his family. 
 WONDER made me laugh hysterically and cry like a baby and sometimes, both at the same time-- like when Jack told Auggie he should sue his plastic surgeon. 
 I loved that this book doesn't make you feel sorry for Auggie (the MC), it opens your eyes to his world and the world of those who are surrounding him and loving him. 
 The characters in this book were so believable. They each love Auggie, but struggle with their own feelings of peer pressure, insecurity and pride.

 I agree, Auggie. Ms. Palacio, I'm giving you one right now, for this amazing book. 
 In case you've been living under a rock, here's a basic summary of Wonder: August Pullman is the new kid at Beecher Prep- in fact he is new to a standard school setting in general, having previously been home-schooled- but that's not the only thing that makes him an object of curiosity. Because of a genetic disorder, he was born with facial deformities that- despite numerous surgeries and medical procedures- are still quite shocking to behold. His first year of ""regular"" school is sure to be a challenge, but it might turn out to be a triumph as well. 
 This is an amazing story. Auggie has a touching, authentic voice and his experiences are raw and honest. On one level, Wonder has similarities to your average school story- friendship problems, trouble with bullies, family ups and downs, and more- but the author raises the bar, and makes this story more important than a simple tale for entertainment. Palacio's writing is powerful; full of pure emotion and some really beautiful sentiments. The main thread of the book focuses on how wonderful and necessary it is for a person to be accepted and cherished for who they are inside- a lesson that can never be emphasized enough.","Sat Mar 23 08:18:35 -0700 2013","Sat Apr 06 13:26:37 -0700 2013","Sat Mar 16 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"False"

 Precept from Mr Browne.... 
 YOUR DEEDS ARE YOUR MONUMENTS 
 ""This precept means that we should be remembered for the things we do. The things we do are the most important things of all. They more important than what we say or what we look like. The things we do outlast our mortality. The things we do are like monuments that people do to honor heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids that the Egyptian build to honor the pharaohs. Only instead of being made out of stone, they're made out of memories people have of you. That's why youe deeds are like your monuments. Build with the memories instead of with stone."" 
 I really like this precept.","Wed Nov 07 08:28:23 -0800 2012","Wed Nov 28 08:53:22 -0800 2012","Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 -0800 2012",0,0,""

 The story is told first by August, also know to his family by the name of Auggie, a boy who has a facial deformity that he's had since birth. Life's about to change drastically for August because this year instead of being home schooled he's off to the public school to start 5th grade. August tells us the first part of the story and then the story is taken up by other characters who illuminate their own participation in August's life. I know some reviewers here thought some of these points of view didn't advance the story but I have to disagree. I liked hearing about those other character's opinions and how they viewed August. I thought it gave the story more punch. 
 It's a moving story because we come to realize that even though August is physically different, fundamentally he's the same as every other 5th grader. It's heartening to see people learn this lesson. It's a lesson worth learning for everyone when we come across people who are different from us. 
 I think this is a book that anyone could or should read but especially middle/high schoolers. They'll be able to relate to every character in the book and the situations presented.","Fri Nov 29 09:38:19 -0800 2013","Fri Dec 06 07:39:54 -0800 2013","Thu Dec 05 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Fri Nov 29 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

 We tend to criticize those who are different and not classified as 'normal' because we aren't open to what we do not know or understand. 
 Wonder lets us empathise with those we don't understand through the points of views in which the story is written in. This is one of the few books which can't help but inspires you and warm your heart. This novel follows the life of August Pullman, a adorable ten year old boy who lives everyday facing the challenge of difference . August, who was unfortunate enough to be born with a facial deformation , must confront his fears of going to school August and all those in his life are breathtakingly beautiful characters who were highly developed and moving to read about. These characters took the readers on a enjoyable journey that I wish did not end -They made this book impossible to dislike. What drew me to August and made him capture my heart was not that he was different but his courage and bravery. That he was able to face his fears even though it was difficult and never gave up, he doesn't wallow in self-pity or choose the easy way out.

 There are some complaints in negative reviews that the characters in this book all sound alike, and that real life doesn't allow for such fantastical turn-arounds in the hearts and minds of middle schoolers. Maybe they're right. 
 And yet, this is a book to love. It might help to remember that the intended reading audience for the book is probably not me (late thirties, English degree), and odds are it's not you, either. The former middle school teacher in me wants to make this required reading for all middle schoolers, and then open the floor for community discussion. 
 Augie's facial defects are described as extreme, but really, there's an Augie at each school, and one in each grade, each class. That kid who for one reason or another is different and perceived to be so. The one who is teased and yes, bullied--the one who is chosen last for teams or groups, the one who sits alone at lunch and recess. 
 It is human nature to identify these differences, and maybe it's human nature to compare ourselves (with relief... thank goodness we're not like THAT), to draw a comfortable line of separation between ourselves and whatever that difference might be. 
 Overcoming those instincts and growing in wisdom and compassion is a good thing, and thanks to R.J. Palacio and Wonder for reinforcing that lesson.","Tue Nov 18 08:31:08 -0800 2014","Wed Nov 26 11:12:55 -0800 2014","Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Tue Nov 18 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0,"False"

 Each of Palacio's perspectives are so well developed I feel like these are people I actually know. Each character's voice is clear and distinctive. I only wish I could have seen the story through the eyes of one of August's parents (but that would have pulled the book from its middle grades reading level).

I wish I had the chance to read this book as a child because It could've taught me an important life lesson. 
 ""Wonder"" is the story of August Pullman, a ten year old who goes to school for the fisrt time after years of being homeschooled. As if that isn't hard enough, August has a very rare facial deformity. August feels like an ordinary kid, and you can certainly agree when you read his thoughts, but his face prevents him from being truly ordianry. 
 I kept wondering what my response would have been had I met a boy like August- smart, kind hearted, brave- could I ignore his appearance and just accept him the way he was? I do know that I will certainly try harder after reading this book. 
 I felt like the characters were very well deveolped and much thought was put into August's character. The story is told through different perspecitves which actually worked great. The only character I didn't like was Via's (August's older sister) boyfriend, but his part didn't ruin it for me. 
 In conculsion, JUST READ IT! No matter how old you are! I'm sure you'll shed a tear at some point while reading this book, and August will find his way to your heart.","Mon Oct 29 07:15:17 -0700 2012","Mon Jun 20 04:37:18 -0700 2016","Fri Nov 02 09:57:10 -0700 2012","Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

Though he is certainly unique among his family and peers, his experiences and reactions to the desire to belong amid both both bullying and kindness were something almost all of us can relate to. I also loved getting the different characters' perspectives. The ways in which most of the characters make assumptions about each other (often incorrect), display their weaknesses as they try to navigate their relationships and understanding of their experience, and allow their strength to develop and come out were all really wonderful, and made the story real, tangible, and incredibly human.

I disagree with some that said the voice wasn't believable, other than one paragraph, when I was really looking for it, I could totally see a ten year old kid thinking/saying these things. I liked getting the perspective of all the main characters and I liked how it showed how you never really know what is going on in someone else's life or what is making them act the way they do. I especially liked the message on kindness and making a conscious choice in any situation to be ""kinder than is necessary."" I admit I teared up a bit at the end and when the one sad thing happened 3/4 of the way through but I think that's a sign of a good book.

 I couldn't agree with the message of this book more. I love that it is written for middle school students. If I were a 5th grade teacher or a parent of a pre-teen I would make this book a priority. There are of course many ways to teach empathy and kindness. This book however seems to have a way of reaching kids. 
 As I was reading I kept thinking about a day when I went to the grocery store with a friend of mine. We were 19 and waiting in line. Someone wanted to go in front of me. I can't even remember the reason. I didn't care. I let them in front of me and continued my conversation with my friend. She cut me off and scolded me, ""You're TOO nice."" I was confused. I didn't go out of my way to be kind to this person. I simply sacrificed all of 3 minutes to allow them in front of me. I was sad that is TINY act in her eyes was ""too nice."" 
 ""Or maybe everyone could be a little kinder. Its just a line, we'll be out of here soon..."" I replied. I couldn't tell you what happened next but now 14 years later she and I are no longer friends. 
 And then all the little bits of kindness I received over the years interrupted my reading.... 
 The first day of first grade my box of crayons spilled all over the floor and immediately with out the teacher prompting the entire class dove on the floor to help me pick up my crayons. 
 The guy at the gym the other day who went out of his way to discuss our workouts and gave me enough encouragement to last the summer. ( He was temporarily disabled...) 
 Or the Santa Clause looking man who bought my breakfast at WAWA before my nanny job one morning. ( He saw me rooting for change) 
 Small conversations, simple gestures.... They are so much bigger than we know.

 Auggie is a 5th grade boy living in New York City. He has been home schooled and is entering a private school for the first time. Along with the normal anxieties associated with this event is the fact that Auggie has a severe physical deformity. He just wants to be accepted as a normal 5th grader but that is not what happens. The book tells the story from Auggie's point of view as well as his family and friends. With all the concern about bullying now this book is a good lesson in learning to accept people who are different than the norm. Looking up the deformity Auggie suffers from will help you appreciate his struggles more.

 My middle-grade-writer husband read this amazing debut middle-grade novel last week, and he cried and cried and cried. While in the middle of reading the book, he asked me whether people stared at me or made fun of me for the way I looked when I was a child. (I had a cleft lip and palate, in addition to a severe overbite and horribly crooked teeth.) The answer was yes, they did...and sometimes I still find people staring at my cleft lip scar. Sometimes children ask me about it. But what I faced was nothing like what the main character in this book faced. 
 August (Auggie) had a series of birth defects that resulted in a face that is mashed up and unlike any other. The book starts with Auggie saying ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid...I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 Auggie has been homeschooled for the first ten years of his life because of all the surgeries he had to endure. (Like Auggie, I also had to have jaw surgery and an implant in my chin.) Finally, as he is entering fifth grade, his parents decide to send him to school. And so begins the story. We hear the story from Auggie's perspective, as well as from his older sister Via and a few of his friends. 
 My husband, in his own review (http://middlegrademafioso.blogspot.co...), writes about why this book is different and has value as a middle-grade novel. I'll leave that to the expert to describe. 
 The first part that had me crying was on page 7. When Auggie was born, he was immediately rushed out of the room, and his mom got very upset. Finally, ""She says that when she looked down into my tiny mushed-up face for the first time, all she could see was how pretty my eyes were."" A similar thing happened at my birth: the nurse would not show me to my mom until she had braced herself...because of my cleft lip and palate. But my mom, too, thought I was beautiful and was just relieved that I was there and my defects could be repaired. I could live a normal life. Auggie's mom, too, only saw the beauty in him, and not the ugliness like the rest of the world did. 
 Auggie makes friends at school, eventually, and he also makes some enemies. People are horribly mean to him everywhere he goes...especially when they see him for the first time. He's a bright, funny, and sensitive kid, as people discover once they get past his face. 
 I loved this story of a boy who finds his place in the world, helped along by people who show him kindness.

 Why I have been putting off reading this book for so long, I will not understand. I expected this story to be deep, because it does involve a main character with a very rare medical condition, and the imminent negativity from those that don't or can't understand their struggles; a trigger warning for bullying of sorts. This book shows how cruel children can be, the anxiety of the family that leave fate to protect their child(ren) when they can't, even if it's something as remedial as them going to school, and how you should NEVER judge a book by its cover. 
 August, from the get go, was going to be a relatable, engaging character who undergoes his own metamorphosis by the last page. He, like most people, I'm pretty sure-like me-saw ""public school"" as this unnatural war zone that would make him feel prone to ridiculing. Again, like I said before: kids are cruel, and Palacio does NOT sugarcoat it. 
 There's this one scene-first off, it mentions, time and time that August is a Star Wars fan. (one of)His favorite character is Boba Fett. The main dick, Julian, asked if he also liked Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious has a disfigured face similar to August's. 
 ""Oohh...no you did not!"" I about threw that book like it was Julian. 
 But, as the book progressed, you do see the random acts of kindness the book, as a whole, weaves together and makes you believe that there is good, and that the smallest act of good and kindness can go a long way. 
 What surprised me was that there were multiple perspectives. Besides Justin's, I loved all of them. It made the story that much raw and rounded. It shows how other people, besides the family are closely affected by how others have treated August. 
 All, in all, this book teaches you that what you put out into the universe, good or bad, the universe gives back to you tenfold. It was such a fun read. I HAD to finish this book because I was literally rooting for August. It literally felt like I went to school with him and became his friend.","Tue Jul 09 19:12:04 -0700 2013","Thu Mar 16 10:23:54 -0700 2017","Fri Jan 15 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Thu Jan 14 00:00:00 -0800 2016",3,0,""

It's Auggie's first time in a real school, and he has to deal with the challenges of harder classes, real teachers and other students -- a lot different than having his mother teach him at home. Compounding this difficulty is dealing with the reactions to those around him, ranging from shock to disgust, at his misshapen face. All Auggie wants is to fit in, have friends, and be ordinary -- even if he is so much more. 
 At first I was distracted by the shifts in perspectives, having chapters in the pov of Auggie's sister, her boyfriend, and the other students in his grade. But ultimately this proves effective to offer insight into their motivations, as it is hard for Auggie to judge who is truly a friend. 
 The shifting perspectives keep the pace of the story moving, and Auggie has relatable experiences with friends, bullies, and family that make the story accessible, especially for middle grade boys.

 I don't even know where to start. What a beautiful, emotional, raw, heart-warming book. I think this is the most eye-opening book I have read in my lifetime. I'm at a loss for words. I found myself laughing, smiling, angered and absolutely bawling my eyes from both sadness and happiness. GO AND READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!! 
 RJ Palacio really opens up your eyes to what it would be like to live your life with any deformity or 'special needs'. The novel switches between Auggie's perspective and his friends and sisters perspectives. This book was an emotional roller-coaster. At the beginning, I found it so hard to read about a ten-year-old boy putting himself down so much and thinking he was an ugly freak. Ten-year-olds' shouldn't be thinking like that but Auggie only felt this way because of the way other people reacted to his appearance. 
 Palacio really captured the minds of each character when writing their section. For example, when the story was told from the perspective of Auggie's sisters boyfriend, it was a completely different writing style. Palacio altered the writing style to suit the character which I really loved. 
 Auggie's connection with his dog Daisy really resonated with me. Dogs love you unconditionally. Auggie felt safe and happy when Daisy was around because he knew that she didn't care what he looked like. There is a quote that really hit me after Daisy sadly passed away (absolutely bawled my eyes out at this!!) ""I wondered how it would feel to be in heaven someday and not have my face matter anymore. Just like it never, ever mattered to Daisy"". That says everything about how dogs are not just dogs. Dogs make us feel safe and loved. I have that same connection with my dog and I felt what Auggie was feeling in that moment. 
 It was really interesting to read how Auggie's condition affected, not only himself, but also his sister, Via. Since the day Auggie was born, their mum and dad made everything about Auggie. Via felt like she was the outsider and that their parents didn't care for her as much as they cared for Auggie. I really like that Palacio covered that aspect. 
 The thing that stood out the most for me was seeing the monumental shift in the way the school kids treated Auggie from his first day ever at school to his final day as a fifth-grader. When he first started school, the other kids stared at him and didn't want to go near him, to the extent where they said if anyone touched Auggie, they would catch ""The Plague"". That was absolutely horrific. Luckily, Jack and Summer put that aside and treated Auggie as he should be treated - like a human being! Then when they went to the nature camp and ran into some bullies from another school, the bullies who had teased him at his own school were the ones to protect him. Everyone at school started to treat him with respect after that. 
 When Auggie was awarded the award for bravery at his Graduation, I was in tears again. It does take bravery and courage to live with something like that because, not only kids but adults too, can be ruthless and judgemental. 
 Overall, this was a WONDERful book (get it?). I absolutely loved it and I think it's the best book I've read in quite some time. I know I said that about A Man Called Ove but this book has left me with so much emotion in my heart.","Mon Jun 26 14:38:58 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 22 21:51:05 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 22 21:28:03 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 18 01:04:05 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 Pros: Everyone really enjoyed the book. Some of us shared that there were a few tears shed during the reading. We liked the switching of different points of view. The author did a great job of making you feel strongly one way or another about all the characters. We all liked Auggie, but there were other standout characters, especially Via and Justin. And no one liked Julian of course, but Miranda was another character who the group thought was unlikeable and had questionable motives. 
 Cons: I got distracted a few times by the out-of-date references: Clint Eastwood, Sound of Music, The little Rascals, Close Encounters etc. I think today's 10-year-old (even in 2012) would use a little more current entertainment references. The book was slow at times - there were a lot of every day conversations. 
 Wonder is perfect for all ages. It is touching, humorous at times, and has subtle lessons about the importance of acceptance, friendship, and family. Read it!

All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong."" 
 This is exactly how I feel as I sit here trying to come up with the words to explain this book and how it made me feel. I'm going to give it my best. 
 Kids can be cruel. Kids can be surprisingly empathetic. That's a part of what this book is about. 
 Auggie Pullman was born with a one in a million(s) facial defect. The kind of defect that startles the unsuspecting, the kind of defect that will stop a person dead in their tracks, and at 10 years of age Auggie decides to go to a real school. 
 It was called Junior High in my day and that started in the 7th grade. Today it's called Middle school and it starts in the 5th grade. According to my dusty memory, this time in a kid's life can suck even if you have a normal face, so for Auggie this year has the potential to be much worse. 
 When he was born he was not expected to live, but he did. Through the years of his young life he had many surgeries to make his face functional. He was home schooled until fifth grade when he and his family decided it was time to go to a real school. As you would expect, he had a hard time winning friends.....kids are shallow. But the friends he won early on were keepers, because they went against the stream when they became his friend. 
 The year had many tough moments for Auggie and many great ones. Told by six different voices, telling the story of the year and of Auggie's life, from each of their perspectives, and it was done brilliantly. It could have become confused and messy very easily, but it was spot on. This book is a little, sparkly, gem. 
 ""The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.""","Fri Aug 09 11:28:20 -0700 2013","Sat Jan 04 19:30:32 -0800 2014","Mon Sep 09 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Fri Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2013",58,5,"False"

 I could not put this book down, except for the handful of times I was crying and couldn't see the words on the page. ""Wonder"" makes me want to ""be kinder than necessary"" to everyone. I was taken aback when I realized that some chapters wouldn't be from Auggie's perspective and I really loved how it enriched the story. I was also surprised that that the adults didn't have their own chapters, but then remembered this is a YA book. And by the end, I didn't need to know exactly what Auggie's parents were feeling, as the author did such a superb job writing from the children's observations. My copy had the Julian chapter included and it was interesting to get the ""other side"". As much as I liked it, especially his Grandmere's experiences during Nazi occupied France, I think it deviated too far from the original story. Maybe the author could have put in Julian chapters throughout the novel to try to explain why he was a bully.

 This is how I show people how much I love Wonder. 
 This is the second time I've read Wonder and this is second time I've quietly closed the cover after reading the last page and had myself a quiet little cry. I read a lot of books and it's rare when I find a book that can make me FEEL something, teach me something, humble me, uplift me, show me my heart and remind me how powerful books can be. Wonder is one of those special books that stays with you long after reading it. It becomes part of your thoughts and when you talk to anyone else that's read it, you can immediately see in their body language as they put their hand to their chest, watch their eyes soften and wait for the words when they say, ""I loved that book so much."" 
 Read Wonder and you'll feel the power and the magic that kindness has in this world.

 I enjoyed this book very much. It was well rounded and captured the middle school experience accurately. Auggie was really just a regular kid who wants what every normal kid wants, friendship. He's blessed with a wonderful family. (And we see how that is why Auggie is also so special.) Auggie has a true friend at the beginning, Summer. I wish we had more of her perspective. I wish we had more people in the world like Summer. Jack's character was realistic. And his POV felt the most authentic because of his internal and external conflicts.

 I'd like to know more about Palacio's writing process, like exactly how stories of the many ""Auggies"" inspired her. She learned about some of the ins&outs of craniofacial abnormalities, it seems, but did she talk to any ""Auggie"" families or did she just witness the one girl outside the ice cream shop? 
 I ask mostly because I wonder about the different ways parents of ""Auggies"" advocate for their children. Their unfailing love and acceptance is beautifully portrayed here. But other than paving the way for him to start public school, I didn't see any other instances of his parents advocating--and by that I mean, they never helped his classmates and their parents to understand why Auggie looks the way he does; no quick talk to classes, no letter home, no networking/socializing with school families. Maybe that's my idealism talking, my vision for what parents of children who are different (read: gender variance, food allergies) can and should publicly do. Because when people aren't given information, and they aren't provided a context for a given difference, they fear what they don't know, they tease, make passing comments, bully--this is adults and children. I want so much to eradicate the kind of bullying Auggie and Jack experienced... at least, I don't want my food-allergic child to experience it. 
 That's a small bone to pick with an overwhelmingly beautiful novel. It's not realistic, probably, to expect this book to do everything.","Tue Jul 17 18:25:39 -0700 2012","Tue Sep 24 07:34:18 -0700 2013","Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

 side note: I was initially a bit horrifed when the jocks started calling him ""little dude"" towards the end of the book and that he was treated as a bit of a mascot sometimes. I do think it adds to the realism of the book--it is mentioned in passing that Auggie is small in stature, that sounds like a semi-affectionate nickname kids would come up with, and yeah, he probably would turn into a bit of a mascot. I felt a bit conflicted about the different ways Auggie could have reacted to that, but I think most kids in Auggie's age and situation would have acted the way the author depicted.","Wed Dec 11 06:20:04 -0800 2013","Mon Apr 11 23:28:53 -0700 2016","Sun Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",0,0,"True"

August Pullman, more affectionately known as ""Auggie"" was born with a facial abnormality. He doesn't look like all the other kids, in fact one of the first lines of the book reads, ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 He has been home schooled all of his life and now upon entering 5th grade, his parents have decided that it is time for him to see the world outside of his home, outside of his comfort zone, and outside of his shelter. This is pretty much where the story for Auggie pretty much takes off. 
 Auggie to me is probably one this list of one of the most memorable characters that I have ever read. Despite knowing that people are staring, that people are talking about him, saying horrible and hurtful things, Auggie hardly ever complains. As unfortunate as it is, he has learned to live with the fact that people will always be, well, people. 
 Something that I really loved about this book is that it is told in different perspectives. His sister and his friends have parts in the book where they explain what it's like to live with August and to live with how other people react and treat him. His sister in particular hit me hard. She explains that she has learned to adjust to doing things on her own and not complaining about anything, not that she is being humble, but because that is just the way things are. August is priority. Each part of the book is beautiful and really teaches you to never judge a book by it's cover. 
 I can not recommend this book enough. I even encourage for younger readers to read this, to help better understand and maybe teach a lesson that everybody is somebody. I completely gave this book five out of five stars and truly plan to read this book again. 
 As with my other review, I will leave you two quotes from this book that I found beautiful. 
 """"Your deeds are your memories."" This precept means that we should be remembered for the things we do. The things we do are the most important things of all. They are more important than what we say or what we look like. The things we do outlast our mortality. The things we do are like monuments that people build to honor heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids that the Egyptians built to honor the pharaohs. Only instead of being made out of stone, they're made out of the memories people have of you. That's why your deeds are like your monuments. Built with memories instead of stone."""" -August

 For anyone who even is thinking about saying this is a kid's book . . . . 
 And also you are wrong. Wonder is a book for EVERYONE. Seriously. Like every single human being on the entire planet. And maybe even your dog. Hands down the best Middle-Grade book I've ever read. So much so that I just did a re-read and I never do a re-read. 
 This is the story of August Pullman and his experiences during 5th grade - which just so happens to be the first year he ever attended school after being homeschooled. Why was Auggie homeschooled???? Well . . . 
 ""Rat boy. Freak. Freddy Krueger, E.T. Gross-out. Lizard face. Mutant. I know the names they call me. I've been in enough playgrounds to know kids can be mean. I know, I know, I know."" 
 Fifth grade is the year that Auggie's parents decide they need to attempt to expose him to the real world. They realize that reality for Auggie might be harsh and offer him the opportunity to go back to homeschooling at any time, but remain hopeful that people will look past Auggie's exterior and see the exceptional person he really is. 
 A little backstory: Awhile back it came to my attention that my youngest child was claiming to be doing his required reading, but really was . . . well, pretty much just staring off into space and doing anything except reading. (He is my child so you have to figure there's some buttholery that rears its ugly head every now and again.) The easiest solution to the problem? Buddy read with dear ol' mom. So I forced him to read my favorite ""kid book"" and guess what happened????? 
 He started flagging quotes just like his nutcase mother . . . 
 Know what else? It really kind of kicks all the butt to have ""book club"" with a small human. We'd read 20 pages a day (the required amount - unfortunately I'm not a miracle worker so he still doesn't loooooooooove the process of reading like I do) and then drink hot cocoa and talk about what we read (to confirm he really was reading this time and not pretending). Sometimes we would share tears and sometimes we would share laughs. We always shared the importance of being a ""Jack"" rather than being a ""Julian."" 
 Small humans final reaction? ""PHENOMENAL. 5 Stars. Every kid should read this and we should read books like this in class instead of the boring stuff they make us read."" 
 My reaction????? 
 This book will break your heart . . . but then it will put the pieces back together again. Filled with lessons of being a decent person that it teaches in the best, most non-preachy way possible. Bottom line is it is just . . . 
 Have you seen Hot Rod? It's kind of the worst movie ever while simultaneously being the best movie ever. My kid is a freaky movie quoter like his mother and encouraged me to overshare this gif. If you read the book you'll see it makes sense. What are you waiting for? Go read it right now. Here, I'll even help you with the supplies you'll need before starting . . . 
 I bought a hardback of this book because it is seriously one of the best things I've ever read. I look forward to forcing my future grandchildren to experience all of its Wonder just like I did to their daddy.","Wed Mar 06 10:42:47 -0800 2013","Thu Feb 25 09:17:25 -0800 2016","Thu Feb 25 15:08:30 -0800 2016","Wed Mar 06 00:00:00 -0800 2013",80,14,"False"

 Upon seeing it, holding it, reading the synopsis, your first thought will be...hmm...it's a children's book. I don't know if I want to read that. I don't know if it's for me. 
 That's what I thought at least, even though I found the synopsis interesting, I just wasn't in the mood to read a children's book. Eventually though, I folded and bought it. Boy, am I glad I did. When my sister saw me with it she said, Oh that's a wonderful book, you'll love it! I asked her, Will it make me cry? She said, I don't know. That depends on you. 
 Well, it did. It brought tears to my eyes and made me want to hug this kid so hard, along with each friend he's made. 
 So let's start from the beginning. This story is about a ten year old boy who is for a lack of better word ""deformed"", he was born this way, and doctors thought he wouldn't make it, but he did. Home schooled his whole life because of the way people react to his appearance, and because he couldn't take people's reactions (people can be so cruel sometimes), his mom finally decides it is time to put him in school. She argues that she can't teach him forever, she's not good at maths. His mom is great. As is his dad. 
 August (Auggie) tries to resist and argue at first, but upon being taken on a tour of the premises and meeting a few of his classmates, he makes the decision to go. Thus begins a very painful journey, watching Auggie have to deal with people's first reactions, the kids avoiding him, refusing to be partnered with him, refusing to eat with him, so far as to create a game in which if you are touched by him you'd have received the Plague. Until that is Summer, who sits with him during lunch, at first out of pity, but later out of friendship, and Jack who becomes Auggie's best friend and classmate. 
 What I loved about Palacio's delivery and execution of this story is he did not focus it entirely on Auggie, but rather gave us a glimpse of how everyone in Auggie's life dealt with it and how it affected their lives in turn. This included chapters narrated by his sister Via, his friends Jack and Summer, Via's boyfriend and even Via's best friend who has always been close to Auggie and bought him a helmet once, which he wore for 2 years in a row to cover his face and was able to play outside without the usual stares of shock and surprise and revulsion. 
 Palacio gave all the narrators a very honest voice, they all sounded sincere and real. It makes you feel like you really are taking this journey right alongside Auggie as we are given a glimpse into all their lives. I loved the relationship that developed between Auggie and Jack in particular. I loved how despite all the conflicts and ""drama"", fifth-graders are so much more straightforward than adults when dealing with things they like or dislike. I respected Jack for owning up to his mistakes, and I respect Summer for confronting Auggie head on when he tried to avoid her. I also absolutely love how the kids stood by and supported Auggie, almost protecting him, when they first introduced him to their parents, going to lengths in order to prepare their parents for who they're going to meet and how NOT to react. Palacio intertwines serious, heartfelt moments with humor that it makes the whole book very endearing and real. 
 You start out wanting to cry and take on all these bullies that are hurting this little boy. You end up crying because you're just so happy and proud of what he's become and the lives he's touched. 
 Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives. That line made my heart squeeze for the little boy. 
 This book may be written from children's point of view, in a simplistic child's way, but this is a book that everyone should read. And maybe learn a thing or two.","Sat Aug 02 07:55:45 -0700 2014","Wed Aug 20 00:28:10 -0700 2014","Sun Aug 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sun Aug 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014",2,6,"False"

 My oldest daughter is 11 years old and I bought this for her. It sounded good, so I read it, too, and this became the first book we basically read and discussed together since she has hit pre-teen days. And, it was perfect for that - something good and wholesome for all ages. 
 Disclaimer: I did not read the reviews - I am probably going to say the same thing they already did, but I feel compelled to share a few words on Wonder. 
 The book taps on multiple, current issues that kids of all ages face: Bullying (in a roundabout way); feelings of exclusion; facing new environments and people; and, overcoming adversity. For everyone, there is heavy focus on the golden rule and manners. I loved that. It seems to me there isn't enough in our modern world on being kind to each other. 
 August, the lead character, goes through more in his life by 5th grade than most can ever imagine. 
 The book is good for teaching empathy and compassion to kids, as well.

 This is a book that as an adult, it reminds me of my youth and how we treated other children at times. As a parent, it's a book that I hope my children, whom have all read it as well, will walk away with a different perspective on those who are different than them.

 Aw. 
 On the surface, Wonder is just the story of Auggie going to school and dealing with all the things that it entails. But in actuality, this book is so much more than that.

Stared at, rejected, Auggie toughs it out with kindness and humor. He wins some valuable friends along the way. 
 I have to be careful not to judge this as an adult read. Parts of the book were a stretch. Julian and his mother were a little too uppity. (Mrs. Albans's incorrect perception of ""special needs"" kids was classic, though. I deal with folks like her every day.) Parts of the book were saccharine (Daisy and Bear, for instance).

I will never forget the impact of ""always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary.""

Some reactions to August were more severe than others. In either case, August was fully aware of others' reactions. That is why he was home schooled by his mom until the fifth grade. August's sister Via described August's facial deformity as ""his features are melted."" A single gene caused August's facial deformity. 
 August's acute description of the pain he felt about the way his face looked, when he went to fifth grade, was painful for me to read. When August walked into school with his Halloween costume on, he ""wanted to be seen. One kid wearing the same exact costume as mine, long white skull face oozing fake red blood, high fived me as we passed each other on the stairs. I have no idea who he was, and he had no idea who I was, and I wondered for a second if he would have ever done that if he'd known it was me under the mask."" 
 August faced ridicule and his peers felt pressure by the ""popular"" kids to avoid August, who was the ""Plague."" Summer was the first girl to step up and befriend August the first day of school. At first she sat with August in the cafeteria because she felt sorry for him. Then she found out he was fun and they became fast friends. 
 Jack was another friend who could have an honest and authentic conversation with August. He liked the fact that August could laugh at his situation. But Jack bowed to peer pressure, betraying August's trust early on in the story. 
 The author, R. J. Palacio, sagatiously described each person's motivations and inner feelings regarding their thoughts about August. Each chapter was told in one character's point of view. His sister Via described her home life with August at the center of the universe, while all members of her family orbited him. Via understood August's needs and loved him deeply, but she needed some attention as well, and often felt she wasn't getting her fair share from her mom or dad. She thought of her younger brother as two people, ""the one I saw blindly, and the one other people saw."" Via was a fierce defender of August, but entering high school, she did not want to be defined by a deformed brother. 
 R.J. Palacio cleverly and wisely touched upon so many important themes - parents having conflicts over the upbringing of their children, peer pressure, character, empathy, acceptance... She even included a brilliant outline of one teacher's writing lesson plans for the year. Mr. Brown insisted that at the beginning of every month, students in his class would copy down one of his quotes, as he calls them, PRECEPTS. These precepts are rules for behavior. Each month, students had to reflect upon a precept, and write how the precept affected the student in some way. 
 The message here for all students is to ""act a little kinder than necessary."" This is R.J. Palacio's first novel for fifth or sixth graders. It is beyond brilliant!","Wed Aug 15 18:15:49 -0700 2012","Wed Aug 15 18:45:48 -0700 2012","Wed Aug 15 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

 This is a story that grade school children should read or have read to them. It teaches tolerance, kindness and inclusiveness. 
 August, or Auggie, was born with a cleft palate and or facial deformities. His mom homeschooled him but in this 5th grade year, they (parents and son) decided to mainstream him. Of course they are all worried. The principal asks a few students to be Auggie's friends and show him around school. The kids are typical in their reactions and responses to him: shock, surprise, bullying, meanness, ignorance. For the most part, they try to help him and soon Auggie finds he has a couple of good friends. 
 Through most of the book I was having a hard time sympathizing with Auggie. Perspectives and characters were on the extreme ends, it seemed. Maybe to help middle graders really grasp what is being taught? As I read I felt talked down to a bit but I think I understood better why as I read. 
 My favorite scene was the camp scene. 
 Many lessons to learn from this story and it's worth the time to read it to elementary age children.

They aren't perfect, they've made mistakes but, they love him and one another. And they want him to have a full life in the wider world,even though it means facing more people who have to adjust to the shock of his physical appearance. 
 If you went to middle school, you know it isn't most people's favorite time of their lives. It's awkward, scary, and isolating for most of us. As life gets better, we tend to forget. Then, you have kids, and oh, yeah, it's a weird time for them, too. If only we could leap into being comfortable in our bodies and personalities and friendships and strengths without going through middle school! 
 Palacio writes about these things through the eyes of several kids. I enjoyed each of their perspectives. I loved the reminder that there's always more than one side to a story -- We should allow people to share their side and maybe we'll understand their actions. 
 Of course, Palacio has given us a touching story with a happy ending. It's not realistic. It is hopeful. Why not write stories of how we wish things could be, show a way that we can work towards? 
 As Mr. Tushman summed up in his graduation speech at the end, this book is about courage and kindness. Wake up every day, try to be kind.

 So. I liked that Auggie's experience at primary school reminded me of my own.. though it was just validation (which doesn't really do anything for me now at my age) I've never come across a story dealing with physical differences and how that affects school relations, and if I'd read a book like this as a kid I would've really identified with Auggie's experience. (For those who don't know, my right hand/arm/chest is physically different... which was easier to hide than Auggie's difference, but when seen, elicited some of the same reactions in primary school.) 
 I also really liked how we heard from a whole lot of characters other than Auggie. In that sense, it wasn't really just dealing with ""disability"" or difference, the story also considered issues of race, class, grief... and these things create different perspectives... so that was great. The one thing that connected all the characters was Auggie... and he was defined a little by his difference in that sense... I don't know how I feel about that... 
 But the real issue for me was the view that Auggie's family takes in respect to his situation... that they see his facial deformity as an inherently negative and abnormal thing. There are constant references to how ""the universe hasn't been kind to Auggie"" and that he drew an unlucky card in being born looking different. Auggie is given special treatment and is spoilt rotten, all because he is different, which is to the detriment of his sister (though this is acknowledged as a problem in the story, the overall representation is that it's normal to fuss over ""special needs"" kids which only highlights that they're ""different""), his sister says something along the lines of how they've all fussed so much over Auggie he ""thinks he's normal. And he's not."" (Excuse me? That's not the problem here!) And the big one: his Dad actually refers to Auggie's start in middle school as ""leading a lamb to slaughter"". Wow. Swap the term ""disability"" with ""gay"" and then imagine family and friends saying these things. I guess you could say my issue really is with how ""disability"" or just plain old difference is sometimes seen as inherently bad, however this story is aimed at kids so I think a more positive attitude towards Auggie's difference from his own family and friends would've been better. And that's not the same as erasing Auggie's experience. It's one thing to represent a not wholly positive experience of primary school from Auggie's perspective, but it's quite another to represent ""disability"" as inherently negative. My own parents never ever made me feel anxious about what opinions I might encounter at school (though of course there were negative ones... but also positive ones!), they've always treated me as a normal kid and it was not a problem! and they certainly have never seen my difference as ""abnormal"", a ""problem"", or something that needs ""fixing"" (and they've got mad at anyone who has ever suggested that it might be.) Had I read this in my younger years, I may've internalised negative feelings about myself. 
 I'm also not sure about the ending where Auggie receives an award, which is given to him just for getting through the school while also being different... I have also come across this perspective. People have come up to me, and have suggested that I be nominated for Young Australian of the Year, essentially because I am achieving things in life but with a funny hand!!! I always want to ask whether they actually think I am good at the activity in question or whether it's just because I'm doing it with ""only one hand"" (please note, only others tend to use this phrase). I also start to think perhaps they think I deserve an award because they naturally think I wouldn't possibly be able to do the activity and are so surprised to see me doing it. Now I don't offend easily. But I find that offensive. But anyway, I have issues with awards being handed out to people for simply dealing with life and doing normal things while also being ""different"" in some way. If you're trying to normalise diversity, I don't think highlighting differences and congratulating people for being different is the way to go. And I don't think it's an uplifting way to end a book. There, I've said it.","Tue Jan 24 18:04:24 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 05 04:36:19 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 -0800 2017",1,4,"True"

In Perks it was like, high school outsider, check, anxiety and depression, check, suicide, check, teenage sister gets beat and pregnant, check check, cool friends, check, cool music, check, drugs and alcohol, check, gay sex, check, family troubles and incest, check, mental illness, big books, large words, literary mentor with patches on sleeve, check check check. 
 With Wonder, the plot flows nicely and without any check list of hot topics to check off. August Pullman is his own kid, liking his own things, and the story manages to keep the reader curious, sympathetic and pulled along without eliciting any forced tears or afterschool special moments.

Palacio has created an amazing, heart-wrenching book in Wonder that will leave you cheering in the end for Auggie and the family he forms around him. Told in eight voices ranging from Auggie to his sister's first high school boyfriend, Wonder is the story of one boy's first year of middle school. This is a book that must be shared. 
 Starting middle school is rough. New kids, new classes, new places to get lost, and new people to make fun of you. Auggie is taken to his new middle school weeks before the new year begins to meet Mr. Tushman, the principal of Beecher Prep. Once there, Auggie is upset to learn that he's not only meeting the principal but that there are students there to show him around. Jack Will, Julian and Charlotte are all incoming fifth graders. They're all supposed to be nice kids, at least according to their lower grade teachers and they've been at Beecher Prep since they were in kindergarten. Yet only Charlotte can meet Auggie's eyes without looking down afterwards. Julian goes out of his way to avoid touching Auggie and keeps watching him out of the corner of his eyes. 
 The strange looks are nothing new, even though Auggie's never been to school before. Twenty-seven surgeries, his size and other medical complications kept him homeschooled at home with his mother until the start of fifth grade. Now that the next surgery is a few years away, Auggie's mother wants him to start attending school. Auggie's worried how the other kids will react to him. On the inside, Auggie feels like an ordinary kid, but kids have run away at the sight of him before. 
 Auggie's fifth grade journey has its dark moments filled with pain, such as Halloween when he overhears a friend say he only hangs out with Auggie because a teacher asked him or when the family dog becomes gravely ill. It has its brilliant moments, such as when Summer sits down beside August at lunch that very first day when no one else will. 
 I loved getting inside the head of so many people in Auggie's life and seeing why they behaved the way they did. Jack Will's chapters brought new light on what had happened earlier and brought home what it felt like to have a school turn on him after he stood up to Julian. Via's chapters rang with love for her brother but also with her shamed desire to not be defined by him. One of my favorite sections in this book came from Justin, Via's boyfriend. He didn't even know about Auggie until the third date. Even though Olivia prepped him for the first meeting, Justin is surprised by what he sees in August. He's determined to make things work out. That isn't what endears Justin to me as a reader. Rather it is how Justin is accepted by Auggies family and how that acceptance eases his tics. It's in how this awkward musical boy decides to help Jack and Auggie. One of the most surprising set of chapters came from Via's former close friend Miranda because it showed how much one girl wanted a family like Via's even with all it's difficulties. 
 The characters laugh and cry their way off the pages in Wonder. The adults and children all have foibles. Some are terribly flawed. All of them are alive. The nature retreat at the end and its aftermath are riveting, an unforgettable emotional roller coaster in a wonder of a book.

So, starting school in fifth grade is a huge step for him, and for all those people who care so much about him.

Everything about this book was amazing, from the way it was written to the message it sent. 
 I'm hiding any plot in case you want absolute surprise it isn't really a spoiler at all but anyway... ""Wonder"" is the story of August's journey through Middle School. It may only be two years but they hold some of the greatest challenges of his life. August must contend with other students and even adults who are against him from the start, as the year progresses the other students at his school learn to accept him. Mostly, there is still a hardcore group that will never be able to see him for who he is. An amazing young boy that has faced more challenges in his short years than they have ever. 
 I think it was the hope that the premise of this book inspired in me that is why I loved it so. I mean, with that said, I'm not always a fan of books that are happily ever after. I am a stubborn realist. This book was different though, it lent something to the story through the supporting characters that made it - if not slightly realistic - but atleast understandable, as well as it being an incredibly sweet ending, but not a book of sunshine. The balance was perfect. And it was this balance, along with the reassurances that it gave me about the fact that there may still be hope for us, as people, that made me love it. 
 It may only be in a novel, but there was something about this book that really convinced me this could reflect actual people. 
 Absolutely perfect amazing. For anyone.

 Wonder is about Auggie (August) Pullman who is suffering severe facial deformity. Auggie has been homeschooled till 4th grade and is going to start school at Beecher Prep. Of course Auggie has always suffered from stares and the mean comments, but he just wants to be normal. I loved how it was told from not only Auggie's pov but from everyone around him. We really got a great insight on how others thought of him and how he thought of himself. 
 R.J. Palacio really captured the voice for each character. She would use phrases that a 10 year old would use or she wouldn't use proper grammar for a 15 year old boy who doesn't really care about his writing, and I really admired that. For example, Auggie says, ""But I'm kinda used to how I look by now. I know how to pretend I don't see the faces people make. We've all gotten good at that sort of thing: me, Mom and Dad, Via."" This isn't grammatically correct, but it is exactly what a 10 year old would say. Another example, is when Auggie asked his dad what understudy meant when Via was performing in a play. 
 I am going to end off with one of my favorite quotes: 
 ""It's like people you see sometimes, and you can't imagine what it would be like to be that person, whether it's somebody in a wheelchair or somebody who can't talk. Only, I know that I'm that person to other people, maybe to every single person in that whole auditorium. To me, though, I'm just me.

 help i have so many feels i don't know where to start 
 See, the main protagonist in this story has a facial deformity. For a kid his age, people will stare and judge without even knowing the actual kid. August Pullman is a hero in a lot of ways. He remained strong and he understood everything. He wasn't those kids who just whines every time he has a problem. That's what I love about Auggie, you know? He doesn't freeze when something goes wrong because he's been through worse. This kid is also smart, understanding, a good friend, and a good son. If Auggie doesn't make you feel warm then I don't even know. 
 The book tackled different perspectives and it made the story much better. We can see everyone's point of view and their feelings about things. 
 This book also made me realize how people can be cruel and self-absorbed. BUT this cruel kids can also change. *cries* THE ENDING OF THIS BOOK WAS SO BEAUTIFUL CAN WE JUST. The kids who bullied Auggie and talked behind his back stoop up for him when Auggie was being bullied. I mean look at that character development. Such round characters. 
 Every character in this book was so great and realistic (lol except you julian i hope you realize that everyone is unique in their own ways and what makes you unique is that you are a little piece of shit). 
 Throughout the whole book, I was looking for the reason as to why it is entitled ""Wonder"", and when I finally found it, I cried. I cried so hard I don't even know why? This book is just so great and wow.

 This was a wonderful & great book about bullying and the difficulties that can face young children in school. It was so touching and heart-breaking to see how this young boy deals with his problems and people around him. To live with all the harassment and mean comments, even shocked looks on everyone's face. This book should me how can you be so powerful in such a mean world. 
 There is no much plot in this book, but it was so good, though. 
 It's about August, a 10-year-old boy who has a facial deformity, his parents decide to let him go for school for the first time after he had been tutored at home forever. Now, he has to face the world in this condition. He has many hard times at school which is so touching. 
 I almost liked all the characters in the book, his family and friends are so caring, honest and could understand Auggie's condition very well. 
 Except for Julian and his mother -of course-, they are the worst! 
 I also love his family and their tight relationship. 
 This book made me cry so hard many times, I just wanted to give Auggie a hug and alleviate his suffering. 
 And this is the most heart-breaking part in the whole book: 
 ""Then why do you hang out with him so much?"" Asked Darth Sidious. 
 ""I don't know,"" answered the mummy. ""Tushman asked me to hang out with him at the beginning of the year, and he must have told all the teachers to put us next to each other in all our classes, or something."" The mummy shrugged. I knew the shrug, of course. I knew the voice. I knew I wanted to run out of the class right then and there. But I stood where I was and listened to Jack Will finish what he was saying. ""I mean, the thing is: he always follows me around. What am I supposed to do?"" 
 ""Just ditch him,"" said Julian. 
 I don't know what Jack answered because I walked out of the class without anyone knowing I had been there. My face felt like it was on fire while I walked back down the stairs. I was sweating under my costume. And I started crying. 
 It is a middle-grade book, but it doesn't matter. I really did enjoy it. It was super easy to read and it gave me all the feelings.

 Wonder 
 is about Auggie, a young boy with an unusual face. His bulging uneven eyes are located an inch below the usual, his eyelids sag, no eyebrows, no eyelashes- just a few of his unusual features. August Pullman is about to face probably one of the biggest challenges of his life- middle school. After being home-schooled all his life, August Pullman is about to go on a rollercoaster ride full of ups and downs. 
 A great read. I thought the plot was simple and definitely nothing entirely new, but it was a good read nonetheless. The events in the book are just what you would most likely expect from a novel about an outcast or a peculiar individual, but still, I enjoyed going through one chapter to another. Auggie was very adorable and his character is what probably made me enjoy the novel most. I loved how his character was young, spirited and optimistic rather than pessimistic or bitter. I loved the sound of innocence is his voice. 
 I also enjoyed the other supporting characters in the novel. I liked how we also get to hear their voices in the novel since some parts were featured in their POV. Although, I think I would have preferred it if the POV was constant, in this novel. This novel is basically your typical Disney movie; a classic storyline but definitely worth reading. Oh, and I definitely loved the Sound of Music references!

This left him with eyes to low, ears that aren't quite right, no lower jaw and other things. His brain works fine though and his emotions work too. People don't know how to react around him. Even after countless surgeries to make his face useable, he still doesn't look like everyone else. August is used to it though, the stares. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't have much of a choice, it hasn't been to terrible...yet. Now his parents think it's time for him to go to school. His mom has no more left to teach him, and he needs to learn how to deal with other people. At first August is hesitant, the life he has now is pretty okay why would he want to change that? August should know best of all though, that sometimes change can be good. 
 August was mature for his age, but only about his appearance. In other ways he seemed like a typical ten-year-old boy. I can't really picture what August must look like, but I would definitely want to be his friend (except I'm not a big Star Wars fan). He has a great sense of humor and is in general a pretty cool kid. I enjoyed that we got to see different perspectives in this novel. It starts and ends with August, but in the middle we get to hear from his sister Via, her boyfriend, her old friend, and a couple of August's school mates. It was nice to get to hear their side of the story too, it made August's character even more developed and lovable. It was also nice just to see what was going on surrounding August, that he may ave not told us, or may have not even known about. I really liked the illustrations at the beginning of each new perspective too. 
 This was a truly inspirational and touching story about a boy trying to grow up without too much ordeal. August realizes he looks different, but he doesn't feel different and he wants people to just adjust to him. I really liked the friendships he made, it's always nice reading about people who show genuine kindness. I also really enjoyed his teacher's precepts, and the ones that the kids sent in at the end of the novel. They completely matched with the kid who wrote them. I thought this was a good little lesson in itself to include within the novel. 
 A great novel for anyone who has ever been stared at because they look a little different. Anyone who has had cooties, or in general was teased for something they had no control over, should read this book. Wonder is a great novel for kids to read and hopefully it will help them remember that all people have feelings. It's a great book for adults too, because as you will see in this novel it's not only children that can behave poorly. 
 First Line: 
 ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid."" 
 Favorite Lines: 
 ""My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.""

 I loved Auggie's story! I think all of us at one point or another have felt judged by our appearance. Obviously, Auggie's challenges were extreme, but the cruelty and kindness of children (and adults) is played out wonderfully in this book. The voice of each character was unique and gave the full story we wouldn't have received otherwise. 
 This would be a perfect book for really any age from middle schooler to adult.

 I liked this book but I did not love it. It follows Auggie, a boy with medical issues starting school for the first time as an older kid. He looks different from everyone else and has to deal with unwanted attention because of it. While I did appreciate the overall message of treating everyone with kindness, the ending kind of soured how I felt about things. 
 So, the school gives Auggie a medal. Not for any real achievement, just because he's different and courageous and inspires kindness or some excuse like that. Auggie is fine with it so maybe I should be too, but it just felt too sappy and unrealistic. If Auggie wants to be treated like a normal kid, then there shouldn't be some made up award just for him. It was like the school turned him into their little mascot, which is not the same as treating him like a normal kid. I didn't like the incident of bullying that changed things, either. It was like everyone went from seeing Auggie as ""that freak"" to ""our freak,"" which is better, I guess? I don't know. Maybe I'm just a heartless person that is uncomfortable with this sort of big, uplifting, sweeping-orchestral-music kind of movie ending. 
 I do think for a younger audience this would be great to get kids thinking about empathy and encouraging kindness.","Wed Aug 31 15:00:07 -0700 2016","Thu Dec 15 16:47:35 -0800 2016","Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Wed Aug 31 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,"True"

 It's a book about a boy who's gone through several surgeries because of a birth-defect, making him look different, again making his mother overly protective of him. Being only ten years old, August's parents thinks he should attend public school instead of being home-schooled as he had been up until this point. He unwillingly tries, and this book is about his experiences meeting new people who are (to him) obviously disgusted by his face. Most people avoid him, but a few gives him a chance and befriends him. 
 What I really like about this book is how the narrative switches from August to August's friend Jack, his sister Via and a few more people. It gives a realistic picture of a school-situation to an outsider, how people don't dare to even touch him, how their glance lingers on his face the first time they see him. This is stuff August pretends he doesn't notice, but who would notice it better than him? 
 I laughed when August and Jack exchange emails (or was it texts?), because I am not accustomed to ten year-olds calling each other ""dude"" every other sentence (even though I'm 17 myself and know these things perfectly well.) 
 I can't really say I can relate to his situation (spoiler: even though it gets better for him), but I know a bit about being alone with barely any friends. It's a strong story, without too much drama. It's very informative, it shows how he hates being called ""deformed"" behind his back (in front of him as well, actually). That's why I recommended it to my mother, being a principal at a elementary/high school (grade 1-10 in Norway) who's reading it right now. At least to me, it was a waking call. It made me want to meet everyone with a smile and never have my eyes linger on anyone who looks different. August was a boy like any other, except he'd gone through a lot in a short life, and people were scared of him because of something he couldn't control himself. I consider it a wake-up call on my way to becoming a better person. It wasn't the perfect book, even though it referenced Star-Wars and Lord of the Rings a lot, so I gave i 4 stars.","Wed Jan 08 00:03:58 -0800 2014","Tue May 13 05:10:07 -0700 2014","Thu Jan 09 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",0,0,""

And she has successfully included not only his narrative, but the narratives of many of the kids who encounter Auggie and are changed by him.

 I think that all I can say about this book to sum it up is It was Truly Amazing! 
 I know I keep using that word but I've read some pretty wonderful books since creating the book club! 
 The story is about a 10 year old boy called August who is born with a disorder which causes severe facial disfigurement. 
 Book Quote: 
 'My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.' 
 The story is written from 'Auggie's' prospective as well as his sister and friends and how he and friends and family behave to each other. 
 The story covers many different aspects of how life and children behaved toward him when he started in a mainstream school and continues over a year as a fifth grader. 
 It is a heart warming story and tells how children can be very cruel to others. Lessons learnt abd a strong message of acts of kindness which in our cruel world everyone should confident to take on board more. It was and an emotional read, I can't lie to you there as I was in tears at certain parts. But, It evolves into a lovely ending and made me cry again but this time for happiness! 
 A truly fabulous book that every child and parent should read!! I'm passing it on to my son Max who is also 10!","Fri Apr 07 00:32:54 -0700 2017","Wed Apr 19 02:14:03 -0700 2017","","Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 -0700 2017",3,0,""

 I absolutely loved this book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It is a sweet, inspiring, tear-jerking little book that I'm desperate to lend to someone already just so I can talk to them about it. Definitely a good recommendation by Waterstones. 
 The book is about a 10-year old boy called August who has been home-schooled all of his life so far and is just about to start secondary school (or the American equivalent). He has severe facial abnormalities due to a genetic birth defect that has caused him to have to endure numerous operations so he can eat and breathe normally and means that he can't help but stand out wherever he goes. The story is told from the perspective of August, his family, and his friends so you get a real insight his struggles and adventures settling into a new school and making new friends. It's done so realistically and isn't an over the top 'cute, innocent child overcoming adversity' type of story. Nor is it an 'oh isn't it sad, what a poor, unfortunate kid' type of story. It's more of a 'regular kid who stands out and learns to deal with it' type of story. It's really heart-warming and just makes you appreciate how lucky you are if you have a loving family, good friends, and all the little acts of kindness that happen in the world each day. 
 I found some bits definitely made me a bit teary. Not because it was a sad book, more because it was just so touching. It's like that section in the Metro where people thank others who have done something altruistic or kind to them. The stories vary from 'thanks to the man at Waterloo station who ran after me to give me my purse when I left it in the coffee shop' to 'thank you to the people on the train carriage with me and my mother who helped call an ambulance and stayed with us until it came when she collapsed on the way to Wimbledon'. I just get so unnecessarily emotional when I read things like this. It makes me want to cry even just thinking about it. It's just so nice. A man ran after me when I left my umbrella behind once and I actually welled up a bit. It's not that I don't expect people in the world to do nice things for no reward, it's just that from what you hear on the news the world is such a dangerous, selfish place so it still surprises me every time. Good job, world. 
 At the end of the book you get that warm, fuzzy feeling and the Head-teacher in the story sums it all up perfectly with his end-of-year speech to the students. ""Be kinder than necessary"" is the message that you walk away with, and honestly I think if you've read this book, you'll definitely want to do just that. 
 For the story, the speed and ease with which you can read this book, how beautifully written it is, and the wonderful message it leaves with you I am giving this book 10/10. I can't fault it. It's just lovely. 
 Soppy review over.

 P.S. I went to see the film of Cloud Atlas this weekend. We were in the smallest screen in the cinema despite the fact it was only the 2nd day of release. It was just as confusing and difficult as the book but without all of the information, with large chunks of the stories missing, and a lot of things left unexplained. My poor boyfriend, Andy, was dragged along and I think probably would have walked out if I hadn't been there. His opinion, having not read the book, was that it made no sense whatsoever, even with me sitting there trying to explain what the stories actually were. Not the greatest film in the world. I think fitting six stories into one book was challenging enough. Trying to fit six stories into one normal sized film was never going to work. It was pretty good to see the main characters changing roles for each of the six stories which included a lot of ridiculous prosthetics and the odd gender change.","Sat Jan 26 09:16:17 -0800 2013","Thu Mar 21 14:29:16 -0700 2013","Thu Mar 21 14:29:16 -0700 2013","Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

 This AMAZING book is simply brilliant. It shows the perspective of a brave boy with a horribly distorted face. Whats fabulous about this book is that not only does it show the view of the main character and the boy with the problem, but the perspectives of friends and family . I think that the most amazing perspective was the sister, vie's. It shows how she herself has to cope, and how difficult it is for her. One of the most touching parts of the story is when Vie spends time with her grandmother and comes back after one month,and, for a split second she sees her brothers face as what everyone else, strangers, see him as. Where as she has got used to him and to her he is just auggie her brother.

Middle grades are tough enough for so-called ""normal"" kids, but Auggie was born with severe facial deformities. Despite several surgeries, his facial appearance is so startling that children and adults stare at him on the street the first time they see him. Those who are familiar with Auggie don't really pay attention to his appearance, but he knows that middle school will be different. Still, you never know how others may react. It turns out that attending school and dealing with all the stares and averted eyes is one of the toughest challenges Auggie will ever face. Two classmates, Summer and Jack, befriend him, but most of the others avoid him and even play a game of Plague in which anyone who touches Auggie has thirty seconds in which to wash their hands. This is one of those novels that allows its characters to rise to the occasion, to be better than they were before or better than they might have expected. While Auggie's bravery is unquestionable, so are the courageous acts of his friends, classmates, and family members. Then, too, Mr. Browne's precepts serve as excellent life lessons, encouraging acts of kindess and reminding his students to take care of others. While he might not have had Auggie in mind when he introduces these monthly precepts, it's possible that they worked their messages subliminally in the minds and hearts of his students and became more than merely words. While the book contains its share of bullies and mean folks, there are many characters with kind hearts to offset them. Although I enjoyed this book thoroughly, I'm not sure that the inclusion of so many points of view helps the story. Some sections are stronger than others, offering a different take on earlier events, but others seem to introduce characters who are only tangentially connected to Auggie. By painting Auggie's sister realistically, she, too, is allowed to show a human side through which she resents the attention given to her brother and longs for a fresh start. Additionally, while many will applaud the feel good ending with Auggie winning a special prize and gaining acceptance, I felt that section went on for a little bit too long. Still, the book moved me while reminding me of how quickly we judge others based on appearance or what we think we know about them. Once again, assumptions lead to misunderstandings and distances.","Sat Dec 01 18:57:49 -0800 2012","Tue Sep 26 17:33:00 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",1,0,""

 So I started reading this book last August 27 and I said to myself ""I have to finish it atleast until August 31, since the main character's name is August."" (Okay I admit it, it is a lame joke.) And yet! I've finished it a day earlier than I wanted to, because who can stop it if they can't help but wonder about August Pullman. The story is just so wonderful, characters so beautiful; it was like seeing the world in the eyes of child, magical and enchanted. I don't even know what to write in this review for I am still getting ahold of myself after crying on the last part. This book should be read by everyone, regardless of age, it will teach someone something about life. It is true that while physical appearance is somehow important, what we make others feel, how we will impact their life, will what matter in the end. And Auggie just proved that. Yes in the beginning, he was so ashamed and angry because of his fate, but he survived, got used to it, lived through it, and eventually learned loving himself (thanks also to his lovely family). And by doing that, he made everyone also love him. And I do love him, too. His courage, love, passion, compassion, and empathy. I agree with Mr. Tushman, that if we all choose to be kinder than is necessary, the world will be a better place. Gosh. It is just so beautiful. So wonderful. 
 And this is one of my favorite Precept: 
 YOUR DEEDS ARE YOUR MONUMENT 
 ""This precept means that we should be remembered for the things we do. The things we do are the most important things of all. They are more important than what we say or what we look like. The things we do outlast our morality. The things we do are like monuments that people build to honor heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids the Egyptians built to honor the pharaohs. Only instead of being made out of stone, they're made out of memories people have of you, That's why your deeds are like your monuments. Built with memories instead of with stones."" -August Pullman","Fri Aug 12 07:52:48 -0700 2016","Mon Aug 29 21:53:13 -0700 2016","Tue Aug 30 23:42:46 -0700 2016","Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 -0700 2016",1,0,""

 Wonder 
 4 stars 
 My AG teacher gave us the summary for 5 books, but not the titles. We had to choose which book we wanted. I chose Wonder because it was the most realistic book on the list, ya know? I'm pretty sure this book is popular. Like, last year I saw it ALL over Barnes 'n' Noble. 
 But the only time it was good was in the middle pages, that's it. I (And I'm ashamed to say.) extremely disliked August. He was so nonchalant and cool about his deformed face that it frustrated me, almost. 
 But overall, I liked this book. Even though I was waiting intently for it to end, I somehow like it.

 A story of an ordinary boy with an extraordinary face tells his tale about growing up, adjusting to a new environment, making friends and appreciating life itself. Told in different POV's from Auggie himself, from his sister, friends and just plain people surrounding him; we witness how this ordinary boy brings extraordinary in every page of this book. 
 August ""Auggie"" Pullman has had multiple surgeries on his face to save his life. He has Mandibulo Dystosis. Although he has this and what they call a ""distorted face"", he's a simple boy trying to live his way through life. Until that day that he begins middle school that is. The day he walked through the grounds of Beecher Prep he began his journey through acceptance from more public grounds. Gaining friends wasn't easy when everybody just can't stop staring and talking about you. 
 This story has taught me so well that not everyone is what they seem. Sometimes people are really shallow when it comes to the physical appearance of a person that we forget that what is important is not visible to the naked eye. 
 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 It took a while for Auggie's schoolmates to get used to him. There were loyal friends and there were also bullies of course but reading about his journey was really great. On how he survived all the criticisms not only from the students but from the parents as well. 
 Through the end of the story, Auggie grew so much and all of the people around him. And that made me happy. I admit, it didn't made me ugly cry, though there were other parts of the book that made me tear up, it's still a great book that will inspire anyone from any age group. Its about family, friendship and love as well. Anyone can relate to this book! 
 ""The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success."" 
 If you want to read about inspiration and appreciate what you have today, then you have to read this! One of a kind story of a one of a kind boy that will keep you reading for more.

 bagian paling menyentuh adalah kisah tentang via, kakak august. kalimat yang benar-benar mendeskripsi via yaitu: 
 ""mom and dad would always say I was the most understanding little girl in the world. I don't know that, just that I understood there was no point in complaining. I have seen August after his surgeries: his little face........ 
 After you seen someone else going through that, it feels kind of crazy to complain over not getting the toy you had asked for, or your mom missing a school play. I knew this even when I was six years old. No one told it to me. I just knew it."" (page 82) 
 dalam penggambaran ini, via banya mengalami hal, setiao kalimat menunjukkan bahwa dia harus mengalah, tapi pada bab berikutnya jelas bahwa via sangat mencintai adiknya, August. 
 paling sedih waktu daisy, anjing mereka pergi. yang pecinta anjing pasti tahu banget keadaan ini. 
 aku suka jack dan bagaimana kisah jack dituliskan. sangat menarik. 
 aku suka ayah dan ibunya, terutama isabelle ibunya. gambaran ibu terbaik.meskipun tidak ada bab khusus tentang ibunya, tapi setiap ibunya muncul dalam dialog, benar-benar menjadi bagian terbaik. 
 sebenarnya, tiap bagian cerita dari tokoh yang ada benar-benar punya kisahnya sendiri dan sangat menyentuh. 
 bagaimana menjadi august dengan segala deskripsi dirinya yang dalam dunia nyata nggak tahu akan seperti apa. 
 kekurangannya, ntah kenapa pada buku yang aku baca, di bab Justin di hal 187-204 itu penulisannya semua ditulis dengan huruf kecil. sangat mengganggu sih, jadi setiap awalan kalimat tidak diberi huruf kapital, begitu juga nama dan istilah.

 This young adult novel hits the right tone: sweet but not sappy, humorous and realistic. The changing perspectives (different sections are narrated by different kids) kept me engaged and served to move the story along. 
 Frankly, I could see a whole other book being written from the adult perspective. What thoughts and anxieties did the parents and administrators have about the children? How did that inform their actions? But, that is my bias as a parent to want to hear that perspective.

Of course, the reason why nothing is REALLY ever the new black is because everything that's supposed to replace black is just the flavor of the month, and everybody with a clue knows this. And being against bullying is the flavor of the month. (Please. Is anyone FOR bullying?) Most of the portrayals of bullying we get are reductive, and the solutions we're offered are preachy and/or non-real-world, and the disconnect between language and action is huge. Most ADULTS, let alone kids, don't see the gulf between the way they talk about bullying while simultaneously acting (subtly or not-subtly) like homophobic, fat-phobic, difference-phobic, inclusion-phobic, classist, racist, privileged, we (I, my kid, etc)-are-brilliant-and-special-and-everyone-else-is-less-brilliant-and-less-special douchenozzles. Look, I'm so irked my syntax is going. 
 Anyway, I loved this book for a zillion reasons, but the primary one is this should be the book EVERY MIDDLE SCHOOL KID reads about bullying. It makes the importance of allies and bystanders really clear -- simply going along with the popular crowd, when they're being mean or smirky to someone they consider less-than, makes you part of the problem. The book makes it clear how hard it is to do the right thing. And it's a BOOK, not a sermon. This is a great story. (Two-sentence summary: Kid with horrid facial deformities starts going to school for the first time after years of being home schooled. And he starts in MIDDLE SCHOOL.) I liked the fact that different sections had different narrators. And that the writing is utterly un-showy. (I've been reading a lot of lyrical stuff lately and it's nice to read something so direct.) And that it's a very quick, fluid read -- I think MOST kids will really like it, not just book-loving kids. It's moving, and it's not pedantic, and there's humor (and my GOD there is a lot of Star Wars stuff). Yay. Adults who enjoy kidlit should read this as a way to talk to their kids about standing up to their friends when their friends are acting dicky. (And the portrayal of a popular, powerful ADULT mom whose helicopter-y, bad-behavior-excusing conduct lets her kid continue to be a bully SHOULD make parents squirm.) The ending was maybe too tidy, so I'll give it four stars as a work of literature and one more for wearing its importance so lightly.","Sat Apr 07 20:01:27 -0700 2012","Sat Apr 07 20:39:34 -0700 2012","Sat Apr 07 20:39:34 -0700 2012","",2,2,""

As well, the climax didn't seem that climactic for me and ending at the assembly was just excessively and drawn out.

It's one of those books that just gives you hope for humanity again. I was also struck by how brave some of the characters are, especially since they're just fifth graders. I mostly read sci-fi/fantasy/adventure novels, where it's typical to see young people be brave and noble by physically fighting villains or taking on quests that put them in grave danger, but Wonder is full of a different, quieter kind of bravery that I am utterly in awe of. I don't know if, as a fifth grader, I would have had the courage to leave my friends and sit at a lunch table with a new kid with a condition that made him not too great to look at (that's putting it lightly), whom everyone stayed away from. I wouldn't have been able to spend half a year putting up with bullies who were picking on me just because I befriended someone who was different. Not conforming is hard, and yet, as this book shows us, when it's done for the right reasons, it can really make a huge difference.

 If there's one major lesson I got from this book, it's that. 
 I read this book and found myself feeling the same emotions as I did while reading The Little Prince. Seeing the world in a child's eyes made me reflect on my values and not-so adult self once more. Auggie's story made me remember what I've recently forgotten: that it's not the achievements that make a person, it's one's character. But how do we truly measure one's character? I guess it's a little bit of how you interact with the people you know and more of how you relate with the people you don't know- strangers for example. Is it the little kindness you offer the world when nobody's looking? I guess so. My most loved author once wrote, 
 ""Kindness connects to who you are, while niceness connects to how you want to be seen."" -Levithan 
 Recognize someone in here? Charlotte? Julian, maybe? You see, there aren't guidelines on ""How To Be Kind"" or else, all of us would be saints by now. Ikr? Haha. One good deed a day is a start. One good deed a day will make a change for me, you, and the world. One good deed a day and we will leave our mark in this lifetime. I believe in that. It was even said in the book by Mr. Browne, their English professor: 
 ""Your deeds are like your monuments, built of memories instead of stone."" 
 Speaking of Mr. Browne, I really liked the whole idea of PRECEPTS. It's like an inspirational, motivational, self-reflection thing and I wish I had this too when I was a student. It must be really fun being a part of his class. 
 So my favorite character is Jack Will. He's so fun and I can see that he's a real friend. He wasn't a very good one at first but I'm really happy that he came to realize who really mattered and he's man enough to admit his mistakes. Sometimes, like Jack Will and me counted, people can be so shallow; only looking at the surface and not realizing that the much bigger and grander stuff is what's beneath. Like one great writer wrote, 
 ""What's essential is invisible to the eye."" 
 Okaaay so why am I quoting so many people? huhu just so many realizations when I read this book. Thank you R.J. Palacio. You made me realize so much from 10-year-olds, which is a shame because I'm already 23.

Well, it IS about that, but the story unfolds using unique perspectives - the eyes and voices of innocent children. The voice of Auggie is so endearing and pure, his observations so acutely aware. The author makes you appreciate the struggle of fitting in (cause we have ALL been there, even without any visible scars, defects...) because for every bully, for every taunt, for every kid who runs home crying cause he is ashamed, there's always kindness somewhere. I found this book in the juvenile section based on a goodreads recommendation, but this is a story for all ages.

I thoroughly enjoyed my journey through Wonder, and was a bit sad to have it end. I had just read the NYTimes article about ways fiction can change the brain ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opi... ), and it occurred to me that this could be a book that could literally change minds for the better. I also think this is a book that students can enjoy as much as the adults who are raving about it. One of my best students just finished the book, and told me she could see it as a great fit for lit circles and discussions among students. 
 Palacio does a wonderful job of presenting this book through different points of view. Much of the dialogue among students rings true, although sometimes I felt the kids seemed a bit older than fifth grade. Would parents really leave a group of fifth graders alone in their home for a party? Nevertheless, I kept picturing fifth graders at one of my schools and the ways they would behave. And, there are many wonderful adult role models in the book, including teachers, administrators, and Augie's great parents. One of the best expressions of their love was when Augie's dad confessed that he had thrown out the astronaut helmet because he loved Augie's face. I liked the fact that children felt they could confide in their families and adults, but not always. 
 I guess one thing that didn't ring true for me at first was how horrified students were by someone so different. Maybe in some ways it was due to the more elite nature of the setting. Kids do like to have targets, but at times I felt that was overdone. I see treatment of students with a variety of physical disabilities at my own school, and the reactions are not as severe for so long. Perhaps it is because my school is much more diverse. 
 As a former science teacher, once again I wish someone would go beyond volcanoes and potato clocks for science fairs! Have students complete real experiments. On the other hand, I wish schools would do more projects like the Egyptian museum, complete with flashlights, another event that Augie thoroughly enjoyed as a mummy. 
 I enjoyed Augie's anticipation for Halloween, and several plot devices and situations that were used. There were characters who grew, and some who did not. The use of quotes, songs, and ""precepts"" was so well done. One of my favorites was when Justin thought, ""maybe the universe takes care of its creations in ways we can't see"". The headmaster's use of ""kinder than necessary"" and Beecher's words were crafted so elegantly. 
 And, I can't help but wonder about the reference Palacio makes at the end of the book to ""the little girl in front of the ice cream shop"" who was part of the inspiration for writing it. I loved looking up some of the quotes, the music, and more. I found her interview http://rjpalacio.com/author.html very illuminating and thought provoking as well. This is a book that will stay with me for years to come, and will make me think of being more kind than necessary, and sharing genuine smiles.","Sun Mar 18 13:55:48 -0700 2012","Sun Mar 18 14:52:04 -0700 2012","Sun Mar 18 14:52:04 -0700 2012","",1,0,"False"

 10 year-old August Pullman likes all the things other boys his age do, and wants to do all the same things. The trouble is, he'll never be like other boys his age. Augie was born with severe craniofacial abnormalities, and even after years of surgeries and procedures, his appearance is still shocking, hideous even, to people who have never met him. After homeschooling Augie throughout his elementary years, his parents think it might be time for Augie to go to school with other kids. At Beecher Prep in Manhattan, he'll find that he can handle the academics easily, but it's friendship, and the stark reality of his difference, that makes his 5th grade year so challenging. 
 This really was a charming book, and a fantastic tale of friendship, bravery, and what beauty truly is. I thought the way Palacio shifts perspectives between various characters (Auggie, his older sister, his friends, his sister's boyfriend) was outstanding; each character had a distinct voice, and allowed the story to go much deeper than if it had been narrated by a single point of view. The shifting pov's also kept the story from feeling too sentimental, or even manipulative, although there were still some parts that felt a little forced (I'm looking at you, Daisy the dog storyline). But these are relatively minor flaws; the story as a whole is marvelous, with rich characters and a powerful message. It'll be leaving my hands soon, and getting passed on to my daughter's.","Thu Feb 16 20:48:03 -0800 2012","Thu Feb 16 21:07:48 -0800 2012","Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",3,1,""

 I read this to my children for homeschool, but I am so glad we read it out loud together, it was such a good book for kids and adults both. I think every child should read or have this book read to them. 
 I fell in love with ""Auggie"" and the other characters, I felt I knew them or lived near them. I hate to part with them and they will remain in my mind for along time and in my heart and soul forever. This is a book that touches you and makes hopefully changes you for the better, forever. 
 I pray that my kids took the lessons from it and apply and remember them the rest of their lives.","Wed Feb 20 11:40:56 -0800 2013","Mon Apr 15 07:32:08 -0700 2013","Mon Apr 15 07:32:08 -0700 2013","Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

 This may be considered a children's book, but it was so special and meaningful and I honestly recommend everyone to read this once in their lives. It made me laugh and I must admit I had a little happy sob at the end of it. 
 From the moment it started I warmed up to Auggie and although I could never imagine what he went through I felt an instant connection. It was so incredibly interesting to see his perspective on things and his conflicting emotions. He is so brave, funny, smart and hopeful! This book really demands you to see past the outside of a person and look to a persons true self. It showed the cruelty of kids, but also their ability to love, often stronger than any adult could. It reminded me of when I was Auggie's age and how kids were cruel to me sometimes but you just need to keep your head up and have faith that there are others that care. 
 I enjoyed the changing perspective and really gave an interesting insight to the other characters that otherwise you wouldn't have known. Definitely for young kids that would read this book it's great for them to see that there is always more than one side to a story. Always. 
 However, I had one tiny problem with Justin's bit. What was that about? The lack of punctuation and capital letters annoyed me to bits! Also I felt like it didn't contribute much to the story. Luckily it wasn't too long though. 
 If you need a happy cry, read this book! You'll love it, I promise.","Fri Jan 22 08:23:48 -0800 2016","Fri Feb 26 09:34:53 -0800 2016","Thu Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Mon Feb 22 00:00:00 -0800 2016",0,0,""

The book is divided into numerous characters who are all given first person narration (including Via's oddly-illiterate sounding boyfriend?) yet all the characters read identically, all sounding like a grown up trying to write like a kid. The writing is never awful per se, but it's never that good either...Palacio is going for the heart rather than the gold, and stylistically, can't hold her own against other voice stylists such as Sapphire, Toni Morrison, Judy Blume, or even J. D. Salinger. 
 Yet, it's a quick, very easy read that pulls at the heartstrings in some moderately effective ways, and it's overall message of doing more kindness than is necessary is worth hearing. But doesn't that message deserve a strong narrative to embolden it, as opposed to a more sad, dramatic rendering of Diary of a Wimpy Kid?

 I teared up so much while reading Wonder. Especially since it's story told through several different points of views of August's year of fifth grade.

This book encourages self examination and invites the reader to ponder what it really means to be a friend, accept others, and forgive. Sometimes friendship requires courage and sometimes it means giving a second chance. I normally do not care for books that switch points of views but this book did it masterfully and it added to the rich characters. As a mother I would have loved a chapter from Auggie's mom but I'm so glad there wasn't one because RJ Palcio knew her audience and stayed true to youth themes. My version of Wonder came with the Julian (the bully) chapter and I was so conflicted while reading it until his grandma's story and I then I bawled. It became very satisfying to see Julian's progression rather than leaving him a villian. The only chapter I did not enjoy was Justin's. Simply because there was no punctuation or capitals.

 Auggie's voice has a great blend of maturity from his lifelong experiences with physical and emotional challenges and childhood vulnerability from his tender age and his loving but sheltering family. Some of his insights can make you laugh and break your heart at the same time. Really well done. Later in the book, you hear from other people in Auggie's life, and each perspective is eye-opening. I especially loved his sister Via's portion of the book, but all of them clearly convey the fact that everyone is going through their own pain and challenges that are just as real as the ones you can see on Auggie's face.

 Sorry. 
 ""Wonder"" tells the story of Auggie Pullman, a 10 year old boy who wants nothing more than to be seen as what he is - a normal, sweet kid. 
 But that's easier said than done. 
 Auggie was born with a rare medical facial deformity known as Treacher Collins syndrome. In public, people are known to double take when seem him, trying desperately to hide feelings of shock and disgust. Because of this, his social circle consists of his humorous parents, kindhearted-yet-guilt ridden sister Via and their dog. 
 Seeing as the dog has no reason to think of Auggie as ""different"" their relationship is very sweet. 
 But everything changes for Auggie when his parents decide to stop homeschooling him and send him to a local private school. A local private school filled with teachers. And other kids. Auggie doesn't know how to act around other people. Will he make friends? Will the other students be mean to him? 
 The book is told through multiple viewpoints: Auggie, Via and new classmates Summer, Jack, Justin and Miranda. Palacio does a great job differentiating their viewpoints as well as their voices, and it helps to create a more colorful picture of Auggie's world. Watching their opinions of Auggie evolve over the course of the book is sometimes frustrating, sometimes encouraging, but always believable. 
 You might go into this book expecting to feel like this: 
 And I'll be honest - there are those moments. But I walked away feeling this way: 
 Because at its core, ""Wonder"" is an uplifting story about learning to judge people on their hearts and not their bodies. 
 Or as it says in the book: ""Be kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed.""

 August ""Auggie"" Pullman has been homeschooled all of his short life due to a severe genetic facial deformity. His parents have (mostly) decided that it is time for Auggie to try out a real school. Of course Auggis is nervous about the idea but after having a tour of the buildings and meeting some of his potential classmates and principal, he feels like he just might be able to handle this school thing. 
 It's definitely a hard transition. It is for any school-age child. But it's especially difficult when everyone stares at you because you face looks like nothing they've ever seen before outside of a science-fiction movie. Auggie plugs along with the help of a few close friends he gathers at different points during the story. But he also has to deal with things like a mother who photo-shops him out of the class picture and offers a copy to any parent who would like one. This same parent ask the school board to consider whether Auggie should even be allowed in their prep school because the school is not an ""inclusion"" school. This same parents' child is especially cruel to Auggie in school.

 August is heading off to school for the first time. He's entering middle school after years of home schooling. As if middle school weren't difficult enough, August has a severe facial deformity. His year is documented by August, his sister Via, and fellow students in a carefully crafted novel that shows the honest and painful life of a child who is different.

 RJ Palacio has written a book that is designated as a young person's book, ages 8 and up. And while the story of a child born with facial anomalies requiring repeated surgeries and still leaving him 'different looking' (read 'deformed') is told in brief chapters and solid writing that youngsters can surely appreciate, the message of the book is equally appropriate for adults. Diversity. Whether that be in physical configuration either from genetic determination or from intrauterine alterations for whatever reason, or from color of hair or skin (think albino), or from result of accidents (think broken inappropriately healed limbs or sever burns) or from language or form cerebral dysfunction - all elements that offer a unique individual unlike peers has an accompanying adjustment from the individual afflicted, the parents and siblings, from friends, from the atmosphere of the schoolyard, and from society in general. WONDER explores all of these in an easy to read, fascinating manner that warmly and fully explores the life of a child how is , as the title suggests, a wonder. 
 One aspect of Palacio's writing that sets this book apart from other that deal with similar subject matter is the brevity of chapters, than manner in which the author places the narrative voice for every person the main character encounters in the first person so that we come to understand even the borderline approach/avoidance conflict of coming into the presence of a deformed child. In addition, each person of importance in the main character's (August or Auggie) life is assigned a section that allows us to appreciate not only the psychology of change that accepting a different appearing child's effect on those around him but also provides insight into the 'problem' being dissected by this book - how we individually cope with diversity. 
 Plot summary: 'August Pullman is a 10-year-old boy who likes Star Wars and X-box, ordinary except for his jarring facial anomalies. Homeschooled all his life, August heads to public school for fifth grade and he is not the only one changed by the experience--something we learn about first-hand through the narratives of those who orbit his world. August's internal dialogue and interactions with students and family ring true, and though remarkably courageous he comes across as a sweet, funny boy who wants the same things others want: friendship, understanding, and the freedom to be himself. ""It is only with one's heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye."" 
 An example of one of the characters Auggie meets - Jack, a fellow student asked by the school's principal to aid Auggie's move from protective homeschooling to his final entrance into public school, speaks in the section titled JACK: 'First of all, you do get used to his face. The first couple of times I was like, whoa, I'm never going to get used to this. And then, about after a week, I was like, huh, it's not so bad. Second of all, he's actually a really cool dude. I mean, he's pretty funny etc.....Third of all he's really smart etc...Fourthly, now that I know him, I would say I actually do want to be friends with August....He laughs at my jokes. And I kind of feel like I can tell August anything. Like, he's a good friend. Like, if all the guys in the fifth grade were lined up against a wall and I got to choose anyone I wanted to hang out with, i would choose August.' 
 And that about sums up why this book is bound to be successful if it can only find the readers it needs. I think it will. Talk about it.

I was a little uncertain about the portion of the story told through Via's boyfriend's eyes, but it mostly worked because it gave the reader another strong focus on Via.

 Auggie who has been homeschooled his entire life and will now begin 5th grade in a traditional school. While other kids are dealing with ""fitting in"" as ""normal"" kids, Auggie has greater challenges. He must deal with fitting in as a child with a severe deformity that causes others to stare at him, look away quickly or be afraid of him. This is a story about parenting, letting children find their own way, bullying, friendship, heartache, bravery and a whole lot more. Each chapter is written from a different character's perspective in first person narrative.

 Halloween is Auggie's favorite holiday, because he can wear a mask. August Pullman, or Auggie to his family and friends, is an ordinary kid in most ways. He was born with facial deformities, and despite countless surgeries, he still looks different on the outside. On the inside, where few people are allowed, he is funny and smart and so so brave. Auggie embarks on a journey much more scary than any surgery - the 5th grade. 
 You will be hard-pressed to find any character as courageous as Auggie in children's literature this year. RJ Palacio gifts her readers with a fast-paced, heart-wrenching, honest look at a great family who was dealt a great challenge. 
 Told from different points of view, the reader not only gets to see inside Auggie's mind, but that of his sister, his friends, and even someone who sees his situation from afar. The role of the sister really got to me (those of you who know me understand why this is so) and I applaud RJ Palacio for giving her such an honest voice. 
 One of the most powerful parts of the book was not how loudly the other kids made fun of Auggie, it was how QUIET they were. It sucks to be called names, but it's even worse to be ignored. The kids at school had a secret game called The Plague, which was compared to the Cheese Touch. No one could touch Auggie without getting The Plague. The thing is, all the kids thought he didn't know...how could he not? This is bullying that no one sees coming. It's hard to identify, and even harder to stop, but it hurts the worst.

 Through August's interaction with his family, classmates and enemies, I've come to question whether I am a good enough person. Its a reminder we all need once in a while, because we all forget the impact we have. 
 In Benjamin Cook's recent upload of Becoming YouTube (Videos #5 & 6), he so eloquently describes: ""we all have the capacity to be dicks and we all have the capacity to be awesome, and we spend most of our time treading the line between the two, clumsily, occasionally falling ass over tit on to one side or the other, then crawling our way back"". 
 So thanks to a couple of YouTube videos, and this wonderful wonder of a book, I've learnt a great lesson this weekend.

I expected there to be some fantastic or science-fictional element because a movie ad shows a kid in a space helmet. Turns out it's entirely realistic. It's also entirely delightful and engaging. We really like how the story is developed through multiple points of view. However, I am puzzled how they make this into a movie that honors the opening conceit: ""I won't describe what I look like."" That element of mystery will be missing from the film, I suppose.

So, reading the first chapter (the first POV chapter of Auggie), where everything is what you would expect from a story centered around a boy who has deformed face because of some blahblah genetics, I said to myself, Well, nothing new here., and yawned. 
 I didn't like the POV of Auggie. It just seems unreal to me. It even bored me a couple of times. Like I said, it's the kind of story you'd expect. 
 And then Via's POV came. And I was like, ""Oh God yes yes let's hear it!"" It satisfied me. Really. The multiple POVs worked for me. We get to understand why the characters do what they do and how they try to let us know their points and situations and reasons they do such weird and unexpected things. And you will really feel their regrets. 
 You will feel the jealousy of Via how great she is trying to understand the situation of her family. How great she is for a sister. 
 You will understand how really nice Summer is. 
 You will understand how Jack doesn't really mean the bad things he says about Auggie. 
 You will understand why Merinda and Via's friendship starts to fade away. 
 I liked the multiple POVs. 
 In short, I liked the book if it isn't told by Auggie. I do not fancy the sun, I fancy how the planets and asteroids and everything revolve around it. I cannot have interests to a thing that moves and acts the way we expect. 
 I didn't like the too much feel-good vibe of the book. And if I raise the ratings of the books with philosophies I agreed to, I will lower the ratings of the books with philosophies I don't agree to. Is this kind of thinking bad? I just don't believe what the book says about how every one of us is special as long as we'll surpass our limits with kindness blahblahblah... just no. Some of us are special, some of us are not. I guess we need to deal with it. And addition to that, I cannot accept that everybody but the real main villain get so super nice to Auggie. They get so kind and everything... 
 So to sum it up, I liked the book. I liked the POVs other than Auggie. I don't like the overly unreal euphoric vibe of the book.","Wed Jul 03 05:23:42 -0700 2013","Wed May 28 22:53:08 -0700 2014","Thu May 29 22:53:08 -0700 2014","Wed May 28 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"True"

 This book, while a bit predictable, is so human and honest and downright daring, that I can't recommend it highly enough. The postmodern chorus of voices works perfectly, especially with one individual whose unique voice is depicted by playing with the text itself, something one would expect to see in a Faulkner novel and not a novel targeted at middle school readers. 
 That brings me to my next point of praise. This book never patronizes its readers. It's certainly targeted at pre-teens and specifically works to appeal to them, but it never shies away from those dark thoughts and unsettling truths that young people experience long before such things are often explained fully to them by adults. I really respect Palacio for tackling these issues head on. 
 I adore all of the characters. They're rendered with a minimalist elegance that makes them come to life without the author having to give a lot of complex back story or contrived dialogue. Really beautifully done. 
 My one criticism is that there is a moment that seems designed to be really emotional just for the sake of being emotional. It's well placed in the book, but it just seemed a bit cheap. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the novel as a whole, but it was the one moment that I saw the author's brushstrokes. Younger readers may not mind, appreciating the catharsis following so much internalized emotion. 
 Overall, I loved this. This would be a good introduction for young readers who ordinarily prefer science fiction or fantasy books to literary fiction. But seriously, everyone should read this just so that they can appreciate Palacio's deft blend of goofy and sophisticated humor and pathos, and get to know her wonderful characters.","Tue Sep 23 14:51:55 -0700 2014","Thu Sep 25 19:46:40 -0700 2014","Thu Sep 25 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Tue Sep 23 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"False"

Also, in my graduate class we were imagining how the story would be different if Auggie was of a different ethnic background or if he had multiple disabilities. Overall, excellent read and I would recommend it to my teacher friends and students.","Fri Nov 08 07:59:29 -0800 2013","Wed Nov 23 08:54:01 -0800 2016","Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

 The story is told from different viewpoints including August, his sister and friends from school. The author does an outstanding job of making characters that are real to me. Often in novels, fifth graders talk like high schoolers and high school kids talk like they are in a sitcom, but the words and thoughts from these kids felt real. Some kids are mean - really mean, but most of them aren't. 
 This book is touching and funny and a little sad, but it is never maudlin or depressing. If we can tear elementary kids away from Dork Diaries and Wimpy Kid books long enough to have a look at this, I think they would really enjoy this story.","Mon Aug 06 09:58:08 -0700 2012","Sun Sep 09 08:50:39 -0700 2012","Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

Aside from his face, which Auggie describes as: ""whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse,"" Auggie is a normal 10-year-old boy. He loves Star Wars, wants to make friends, and cares what people think of him. Wonder is the story of how his new 5th grade classmates -- and we readers right along with them -- learn to see beyond Auggie's extreme looks into the sweet, clever, funny soul that lies beneath. 
 Wonder is what I would call an ""empathy builder"" book. It exposes readers to a world we have never before considered, in a manner that makes us care. Like Out of My Mind, about cerebral palsy, and Rules, about autism, Wonder gently slides us into the shoes of a boy whose face scares small children, and asks us to walk a mile. It would be easy, as a Book Reviewer, to get snarky and dismiss this as just another tear-jerker about differences and bullying. But I won't do that, and I will tell you why. 
 First of all, Wonder is skillfully rendered. I was taken in by Auggie's story, by the challenges faced by not only Auggie himself, but his sister and his friends. I stayed up late to finish this book, and relished its happy ending, even if it is clear that, happy 5th-grade ending or not, Auggie's life will never be easy. 
 More importantly I believe there is a critical place for these books in the lives of young readers. Kids have a pretty brief window to learn empathy between the time when they are too young to understand difference and the time when they lose the ability to see beyond their own adolescent challenges (read: acne, dating, risky behavior, etc.). I would put this time period loosely between 4th and 9th grade. If we want our children to grow into kind and ethical adults, it is ESSENTIAL that they are exposed to ideas about difference, prejudice, and the impacts of human cruelty during this critical period. Call it character education if you like. 
 This alone is the most important reason to read fiction. It takes us to places, and introduces us to people, that we might not run across in your typical middle school, but that have important lessons to teach. People like Auggie. 
 During this brief character-building period, kids may find that one book can change their life. This book needs to come at the right time, and needs to feel fresh and timely. That is why books like Wonder: well-written, compelling books about a kid you can't help caring about, who just happens to look like no one you have ever met, should keep being published, read, and awarded prizes. These books do important work.

His mother decides to send him to a mainstream school for fifth grade after having homeschooled him up to that point. His father worries that he'll be ""eaten alive."" The principal of the school assigns three of the ""good kids"" to show him around and basically be his friends. But that task is more than some of them can handle. However, he finds true friendship with a girl named Summer, who is kind to him without having to be asked. 
 Wonder is told mainly from Auggie's point of view but also includes the points of views of other people in his life, like his older sister and some of the kids at his school. It's interesting to see that different people have different perspectives on the same situations and events. I think that's a good lesson that you never know what is going on behind the scenes in people's lives and that you should try and find out before you judge them. And even if you don't find out, give them the benefit of the doubt and treat them with kindness. 
 My boys, who are ten and twelve years old, and I each read this book on our own and then went out lunch to discuss it, - a little mother and son book club. I was surprised at how in-depth our discussion was. This book touched them and made them think. Even though it's a middle-grade book, I think it would also be a good selection for a teen or even adult book club. 
 A movie based on Wonder is coming out in November. Jacob Tremblay, the child actor who was so great in Room, plays Auggie. My boys and I are looking forward to having a mother and son date to see it. 
 Wonder has wonderful lessons to teach and I recommend it for kids and adults alike.","Wed May 31 15:31:10 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 02 16:21:04 -0700 2017","Thu May 25 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",0,0,""

 Okay, I'm just going to say it: Wonder by R.J. Palacio -- it's wonderful. 
 Couldn't be helped. Had to say it. And not just because it's a super cheesy thing to say and I'm a super cheesy person; I had to say it because it's true! 
 Wonder is about Auggie, who has been home schooled all his life because of his deformed face and all the medical procedures he's had to undergo. But now Auggie is headed to regular school for the first time -- and that would be nerve-wracking enough for a regular kid; for Auggie, it equals total upheaval of his life. 
 But that description doesn't do justice to the book and how totally, totally awesome it is. Because when you read Wonder, you won't think of Auggie as an interesting character with an interesting story; you'll think of him as a real kid, just like one of your friends, or even kind of like you. 
 To find out what happens when Auggie gets to school, and to hear more from him, his sister, and the other kids at his school... obviously, you should read the book!

 Discussion Questions 
 Remembering: What major event is August going through at the beginning of the novel? 
 Understanding: How and why is Auggie different from other kids his age? How does he handle these differences? Explain. 
 Applying: Think about your own experiences at school. Describe a time when you felt different from everyone else; or, a time when you wished you could be invisible (or both). 
 Analyzing: A static character is one who stays the same throughout the entire story. A dynamic character is one who changes as the story progresses. With these two definitions in mind, try to classify each of the major characters in the novel as static or dynamic. Be sure to give at least one example from the text to support your classification. 
 Evaluating: Is Wonder a good title for this book? Support your opinion with specific reasons or details from the novel. 
 Creating: Imagine the author has asked you to add one new character to the current ""cast"" of the novel. Name your character, and explain what their special job will be in the story. Make sure they fit in as seamlessly as possible with the other characters (i.e. no evil space robots trying to take over the world... unless you can really sell it).","Tue Jul 02 08:44:54 -0700 2013","Fri Jul 05 13:09:33 -0700 2013","","",1,0,""

 If you haven't read this book yet, I encourage you to pick it up as soon as possible. It will inspire you and encourage you to be a better person and more aware of other people's feelings. 
 August Pullman is a normal kid, smart, friendly, and funny, but the thing that sets him apart from other kids is what is on the outside. 
 He has many different genetic problems that make him look monstrous. Horrific. Not human. And everyone at school acts like he has the plague- they flinch if he touches them and can't even bear to make eye contact with him. Even though it is not his fault that he was born that way, he pays for it every day. 
 How often do we judge people from how they look? How often do we turn away our eyes because we can't bear to look, or how often do we make fun of others because of disabilities or deformities that they have? 
 I have experienced these feelings firsthand in my life. Although it does not affect how smart I am or how I think or anything like that, but it does affect many physical aspects of my life. 
 Even though some people may not mean to stare or be rude, that doesn't mean that I am oblivious to the stares when I turn my back, or the whispers as I walk through the hall. Whenever I run, I always feel stares on me, or even just walking down the halls. {I don't walk like other people do, and the difference is pretty obvious.} 
 Now that I'm older, people have gotten kinder and more sympathetic, but back in elementary school, I got bullied a lot. In first and sixth grade, it was especially easy to bully me because I had surgeries that required me to be in a wheelchair. I'm not saying that everyone was mean- most people were really nice. However, there were a few people who thought it was funny to whisper mean things to me when the teacher was looking away. 
 I'm here to tell you that all the people I've met with physical disabilities have been the sweetest and friendliest people that I've ever met. Don't judge people because of what you see on the outside- they can't change it and it hurts their feelings when you bully them. 
 I'd rather be seen as a girl with cerebral palsy that everyone can count on to be a good friend than a bully with nothing wrong with her.

Auggie has been home schooled his entire life because he was born with a face that is different. Auggie's parents feel it's time for him to try public school and they send him to Beecher Prep. Auggie's year has it's ups and down, he encounters some wonderful teachers, some kind students, and some students who try to make his life difficult. But Auggie has an inner strength and a loving family that help make the transition and the school year a positive one. 
 My favorite quote from the book is... ""Shall we make a new rule of life...always try to be a little kinder than is necessary?"" -- J. M. Barrie from the book The Little White Bird. Kindness often seems like a little thing, but in Wonder, you see what a really big thing it is, and the difference it can make in our lives. 
 Wonder is one of those books that makes me absolutely LOVE reading and books and sharing them with others.

 Auggie is likeable, so is Via, his mum, his dad, his headteacher Mr Tushman ... everyone is lovely and sweet and kind. 
 Except for Julian. He's bad, just because he's the baddie. No reason other than that. 
 Personally I would of liked there to have been more depth to the characters. 
 For a moment I thought I was going to get it from Auggie's big sister Via when the narrative moved to her POV. I wondered if we'd get more resentment from her (for Auggie taking time away from her parents). More temper tantrums. Maybe they could've fallen out and then resolved their differences at the end. 
 I would've liked to have had Julian's point of view. Why did he act so mean to Auggie? What motivated him to act so cruely? What hardships did he have to go through that made him so bitter towards a young boy with a facial disfigurement? 
 Or perhaps the story could've even been turned on it's head and Auggie could've been made to look bad from Julian's point of view. Maybe unknown to Auggie he did something that upset Julian in kindergarten. 
 Basically the whole story was played safely. 
 Which is either good or bad depending on what you want out of a novel. From the reviews I'd read I was expecting more. Maybe that's unfair for me to say. 
 The best way I can summarise this book, so that you know what you're getting, is to say: 
 Wonder is a nice gentle read with a happy ending.","Mon Nov 05 08:13:37 -0800 2012","Wed Jan 30 09:43:18 -0800 2013","Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

 Oh, this book. I just love it. Auggie is a boy who has some pretty severe facial deformities and starts fifth grade in a prestigious prep school after being homeschooled to deal with the multitude of corrective surgeries in the early stages of his life. 
 This is Auggie's story of his transition to middle school, an ugly place at the best of times, and how he struggles, and perseveres. Auggie's story is told from his perspective, as well as the perspectives of his sister and classmates.

This is the time in their lives that they, themselves and other people are judging them.

He was born with a severe facial deformity and has spent his entire life dealing with people's reaction to his appearance. Due to the large number of surgeries and health issues he experienced as a young child, Auggie has always been homeschooled - until his parents decide that 5th grade would be the perfect year for him to go to a real school and interact with real kids. 
 And that is where the main conflict of this story begins. 
 What is so extraordinary about Wonder is that there are many different points of view to explore and discuss. Auggie is never explicitly bullied at school, but he experiences a great deal of unkind treatment from classmates. But there are also the behaviors of his classmates and family members that kids can discuss and empathize with. This is a novel that shows kids there are no simple answers in life. 
 I'm sure this phrase has already become cliche even though the book has only been out for a couple weeks now but Wonder is a wonder of a book. It's something you read that will stay with you for a long time. Auggie is one of the most lovable, empathetic characters I've ever encountered in my reading life. There's a scene in the book where Auggie's father hugs him and tells him how much he loves his face, and that very scene made me long to do the same thing for him. I loved Auggie in that moment in the same way his parents did. 
 If I had one criticism of the book it's that the ending was a little too perfect for real life, but at the same time, it was absolutely necessary for readers to feel satisfied that karma finally showed some kindness to Auggie. You can't leave readers feeling like the hand Auggie had been dealt was still rearing its ugly head. 
 If you're a middle grade teacher searching for your next great read-aloud, I can't recommend Wonder enough.","Thu Sep 15 08:37:56 -0700 2011","Tue Feb 10 17:42:15 -0800 2015","Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 -0800 2012",1,0,""

He was homeschooled for most of his life but now his parents have decided that he needs to go to school...just in time for middle school. Still, against all odds, Auggie makes some friends. (And, of course, spends a not-small amount of time being stared at and then avoided.) 
 Oh, you guys, this book. I have not loved a book like this since The Pull of Gravity. (In fact, I think this book is probably what would happen if TPoG and The Fault in our Stars got together and had a book baby.) I know it's a total cliche, but this is the kind of book that changes lives and definitely the kind of book that turns me into a crazy person and start brandishing it at strangers, saying, `GUYS. READ THIS. READ THIS NOW."" 
 I've become a total sap in my old age (32 in April) and I find that the two things that make me cry most often are blatant cruelty and unexpected kindness. There's a lot of both in this book. 
 It's pretty impossible not to fall in love with August and his obsession for all things Star Wars. But it's just as hard not to love his family (his parents and his older sister Olivia---or ""Via""), who love Auggie as fiercely as...well, as I do, at this point. And the group of friends that Auggie makes are pretty awesome as well. 
 I don't think I can talk about this book like a normal person. It's sweet and sad and profound and brilliant, but when I try to expound on that (so that people will want to buy this book), I just keep coming back to ""This is probably the best book I will read this year.

 Wonder soon submerged me fully into the world of August; the book itself was written in the various mindsets of the characters.

 Had I known how popular it was, I probably would have really had a mental resistance to reading it, but as it was, I walked into it knowing that the friend who picked it for our monthly fiction book club felt really compelled to read it. I trusted her. 
 It's a book that's written from the heart and one of the things that I loved about it was the author's use of point-of-view. You don't just hear the story from the boy with the deformed face; you also get a good view of how things are for other characters in the story.

I have math this period, and we've got a lot to do. We only got about halfway through in class, and we stopped altogether after Christmas break. Still, the book had intrigued me, so when I saw it at the library at the school were my mom is principal, I sorta stole it. I'm putting it back tomorrow though, so it's not really stealing, and I asked my mom if I could. The story is of a boy named August, who, for lack of a better term, is 'facially challenged'. He thinks and acts like a normal kid, but his looks get him generally ridiculed. His life takes a drastic turn when he enrolls in school for the time. The story is told through multiple POVs, like his sister, Via,, his friends Summer and Jack, and Via's boyfriend, Justin. The frequent change in the narrator gives an interesting outlook on August. It sends out a message, rather like the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"", but it basically means ""don't judge a person by their appearance"". 
 The only real problem I had with this book was in Justin's POV. All through that, words like 'I' and proper nouns weren't capitalized, and not even the first word of the sentence was capitalized! There were no quotation marks around dialogue either. That nearly drove me insane! I would've really enjoyed reading about his experiences if only it was written correctly! I love his character, and his and Via's relationship was super cute. It would've gotten all 5 stars if it wasn't for that section. Overall, I loved the book 
 Wait: did anyone else have that problem in Justin's part, or did I just steal a defective copy of the book???","Sun Apr 14 17:51:21 -0700 2013","Sun Apr 14 18:11:27 -0700 2013","","",0,0,""

 This is an impossible book to dislike. It's so full of human emotions - kindness, love, courage, determination, fear - and so full of beautiful messages. 
 August Pullman is a wonderful boy. Not retarded. He functions normally and is pretty smart. But he is facially deformed, which makes it psychologically challenging for him to go out, let alone attend school. 
 But his mom thinks it's time for him to stop being homeschooled. At school, he makes friends who help him feel like he belongs and enemies who remind him that he will never be a normal kid. Auggie wishes to show people that there is more to him than his appearance, but not everyone is receptive. 
 Told from various point of views in a very truthful and heartfelt manner, this story celebrates differences and proves that the human being is more good than bad.

The Julian chapter in the end really gave a lot of closure and perspective as to why children feel the need to bully. This book is important for not only children to read, but everyone to read. R.J.

He was perhaps three or four years old. A sensitive little girl a year or so younger began sobbing when she saw him. What would it be like to be a child so handicapped? 
 ""Wonder"" answers that question beautifully. As Auggie enters fifth grade and goes to a public school for the first time, we live his experience through several points of view - his own, his sister's, his sister's friends, his own classmates'. Auggie is, in many ways, a lucky boy. He is smart and brave, and his loving family is solidly behind him. Many of his teachers are remarkable, and so are a couple of his classmates. Needless to say, this is still an incredibly challenging year for him. 
 An adult reading this book will appreciate the innocence of the children's voices, the clarity of the different points of view, and the life-affirming messages. A child, most likely, will root for August and his friends and look for comeuppance for his enemies. Both groups will find this warm and well-crafted novel entirely satisfying.

 This book is amazing. August Pullman is a kid born with a serious facial deformity. ""Whatever you're imagining,"" he says, ""it's probably worse."" For his entire life, he's been homeschooled, mostly due to his medical issues. But now that he's 10, he's stable enough to go to school for the first time. 
 Guess what? Middle school sucks, especially when you're the new kid. Middle school sucks even when you don't have a face that scares people away. His start at the school is less than auspicious, but somehow he manages to overcome, even though kids are cruel and total jerks. 
 I really enjoyed the way Palacio told Auggie's story from so many different viewpoints. I usually don't like that sort of thing; it tends to be extremely distracting. But somehow it made Palacio's story so much stronger to see Auggie from so many different viewpoints.

It follows the story of young August, a boy with severe face abnormalities that set him greatly apart from anyone with a ""normal"" physical appearance. Auggie has been home schooled his whole life, up until now. And fifth grade has never seemed more impossible. 
 From page one, I felt myself rooting for August. I cheered for him in his highest moments and cried with him at his lowest. It's been a long time since I've read a middle grade novel with such a wholesome character. R.J. Palacio has created a little boy who simply captures your heart. Auggie felt so real, it was like reading the story and struggles of someone I know. 
 One aspect I really liked about Wonder was the shifting points of view. I wasn't expecting to get this kind of dimension in the novel, but it did nothing but add to the already touching story. I absolutely loved the different voices that R.J. Palacio included. Each character was clearly individual, with their own goals and weaknesses. This made the story much more real to me. 
 I'm so glad picked this book up. So far, it is my favorite read of the new year. The issue of bullying and the idea of spreading kindness is something that every young person should learn about, and this novel covers it in such a way that steals your heart and doesn't let it go until the very last page.

Palacio is one of the most unforgettable stories I've ever read about someone with a physical deformity. It centered around the main character, August ""Auggie"" Pullman and dealt with the fact that he was born with a severe facial malady that requires a variety of surgeries causing him to live as a semi-recluse and be home schooled by his mother, Isabel, until she can't help him any longer, due to her poor math skills, and enrolls him in ""Beecher Prep"" for the 5th grade. That set the premise for a tale that follows Auggie through his first year at middle school. 
 Set in New York, and alternatively narrated by Auggie, his sister Via (Olivia), his friend Summer, his friend Jack, Via's boyfriend Julian and Via's friend Miranda, their voices allow the reader to enter a world many might not know about because they're not in middle or high school any longer. As they tell their accounts of their's and Auggie's year I felt they were both inspiring and heartbreaking and they demonstrated how difficult it is to be different in our world. Challenging issues such as bullying, insecurity and stress were addressed in this book giving it a very modern feel and making it relatable for anyone who reads it, whether they are a child, teen or adult. 
 Even after I finished it I found myself thinking about it and being inspired by it's message. Ultimately I feel it's a beautiful story that fits into a genre full of other beautiful stories of characters who have lived through obstacles and overcome them.","Mon Feb 25 18:26:59 -0800 2013","Sat Mar 16 07:11:06 -0700 2013","Sat Mar 09 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

The plotline and characters are unique, without becoming preachy. Yes, the ending is happy and the bully problem is solved, but it didn't seem heavy-handed. I especially liked the glimpse of Julian's parents, just to show that these kinds of things are not just ""kid-stuff"". The story was told from a variety of POVs which is something I particularly enjoy in a reading experience. I would have liked to see a Julian POV, or maybe even one from Mr. Tushman, perhaps in place of Justin's. Also, in Justin's chapters, it seemed to be hinted at that he had some form of autism, which I would have liked more clarity on. That might have explained the significance of his POV, rather than just being the sister's boyfriend. Anyway, everyone and their interactions seemed very real, and I especially liked the way the Auggie/Jack storyline played out. My heart broke for Auggie on Halloween.

However, it's even more overwhelming when you're unlike the rest of the student body. This was August Pullman's situation. August, referred to as ""Auggie"" by friends and family members, was born with a genetic abnormality known as mandibulofacial dysostosis which, as his sister put it, ""made war on his face."" Because of this, Auggie is constantly bullied, with others staring, screaming, or making rude comments directly to him. 
 Over the course of one year, Auggie faces considerable challenges, yet makes significant growth. With the story told from multiple points of view, you are able to gain a deeper understanding of each character and experience the tremendous obstacles they face as the story unfolds. Each character, so unique and different from one another, shares their raw emotions - what life is like in their shoes as a friend or family member of Auggie. R.J. Palacio doesn't hold back, enriching the reader's connection and overall experience. 
 In this inspiring novel, you will learn about kindness, friendship, and courage. Courage to stand up for what you believe in. Courage to be yourself. And the courage to make a difference. This will be a book that you will remember for a very long time.","Sun Mar 17 19:48:26 -0700 2013","Tue Apr 09 21:02:37 -0700 2013","Tue Apr 09 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Sun Apr 07 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

I can't describe it to you to make you actually feel the emotion and let's you connect with the character, so I'll take an excerpt from the book. 
 ""No, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. like with parents who adore you blindly. and a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. and a little gravelly-voiced kid whose friends have left him over you. and even a pink-haired girl who carries your picture in her wallet. maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds.""

 ---------------------------------------------------- 
 Okay, this book is goooood! BTW, I went to Korea with my fam so that's why this is late. I will also post about my Korea trip in my blog! (soon) 
 Thoughts: 
 * This book is so beautiful, ahhhhh! 
 * Okay, in this book there were multiple points of views and that was cool. But what was really cool was that when we change POVs, the tone would also change. Let me give you an example. When we read from August, a 5th grader's POV, the tone of the POV is from a 5th grader. It doesn't have deep words and it is very easy to understand. When it changes to Olivia's POV, the tone is from a High School-er. Her POV has deeper words and stuff like that. To some of you this wouldn't be a big deal but for me, it kinda is. Usually in books that have 2 or more 1st person POVs, I would forget I was reading from this character and I would get confused. ""*insert character's name* wouldn't do that! Why are you looking at yourself- oooh, I'm in*insert other character's name* 's POV. Oooohh"" 
 * Having a face deformity is so hard. I can imagine how August felt when everyone was staring at him, whispering behind his backs, making him feel alone. Why must you do that, everyone? wHY?! 
 * Who wants to punch Julian? Me. 
 * I was so happy when Summer befriended August. ILY SUMMER 
 * there was pov (justin's) and everything was small caps. it was so cool. 
 * That time when Jack insulted August behind his back? I wanted to strangle him. 
 * ILY Amos, Henry and Miles! (at the end) I still want to punch you, Julian. 
 * When August won the award, I got a little bit teary-eyed. 
 * THERE ARE SO MANY QUOTES AGAIN I LOVE IT 
 That's it! Here are the quotes! 
 ""Funny how sometimes you worry a lot about something and it turns out to be nothing."" 
 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 ""It's like people you see sometimes, and you can't imagine what it would be like to be that person, whether it's somebody in a wheelchair or somebody who can't talk. Only, I know that I'm that person to other people, maybe to every single person in that whole auditorium. To me, though, I'm just me. An ordinary kid."" 
 ""It's not enough to be friendly. You have to be a friend."" 
 ""Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives because we all overcometh the world."" 
 ""Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed."" 
 ""If every person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you wil try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God."" 
 ""The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success."" 
 ""Jack, sometimes you don't have to be mean to hurt someone."" 
 ""Here's what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.""

It is also about the different perspectives of the people around Auggie, like his friends, his sister, and his sister's friends. There were times in the book where I just want to hug Auggie. 
 It is amazing, actually it was beyond amazing. It made me laugh and cry hysterically. It was heart-warming. It made me look back on the things I did, the mistakes I made. To not judge based on the appearance of someone, because that's the most irrelevant part of knowing someone for me.

I wish I had read it with my 9-year old but I ended up telling him what happened in each chapter as I went along and he enjoyed following along too. 
 It's a touching story, a little bit heart-breaking; you want so much to tell this kid, ""Hey, it gets better"" but on the other hand ... will it really? His disfigurement is so profound and severe that getting out of school and into adult life isn't likely to make the stares and comments go away. The bravery that it must take just to go out and face the world every day ... you want to hug this kid and just somehow make it better for him. 
 The scene where the babysitter herds the kids away is so real and poignant; I could completely imagine being the sitter and feeling terrible about rushing away but also being just as determined not to let the kids say the wrong thing and hurt the boy's feelings.

 Being accepted is brilliant because you feel like you are worth something and this book made me realise that the people who never understood why I liked guys had to learn it for themselves.

 --The characters were all a little flat. Although we got to hear different voices through the book, the narration was pretty similar throughout, so much so that I was startled when one of them had a weird capitalization habit, and realized they were all supposed to be different voices. 
 --Emotional changes happen so fast. They get a new dog right away without even mourning their old dog? 
 --I guess I expected more of August. I saw some of the whiney self-centeredness, but I didn't see him reject it by the end. I wanted him to be something spectacular under that face, and I feel like the book worked hard to make his journey be ""to become ordinary."" 
 --I wanted the book with that title to be filled with wonder. 
 I wanted this to be Rebecca Stead's Liar and Spy. A book which like this one, deals with bullying, but deals with it beautifully. Or The View from Saturday which is a book with a lot of different voices in which each voice is vivid and distinct. So it was fine, and I liked it, but I expected more.","Fri Nov 30 04:59:55 -0800 2012","Tue Feb 18 02:51:42 -0800 2014","Tue Feb 18 02:51:42 -0800 2014","Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 -0800 2014",1,0,"False"

Due to a combination of genetics he has a facial deformity and doesn't look normal (kids call him Zombie behind his back), but is normal in just about every other way. 
 Loved it. Characters are always a major selling point for me, and the characters were so real and human in this book. They carried the story with their honesty . . . kids make fun of August, while others are kind. Although I think they seemed a little older than 5th grade- more like 7th to me. When I first started reading, I thought it was only going to be from the POV of August, but when it switched to other characters I loved it! The perspectives and background stories of the other characters made it much more interesting and rounded. Like maybe you thought August had it rough, but once you hear from the others you realize that they have their struggles too, and August actually has some really great things going for him. The way this was written really shows the difference one person can have on other people's lives. 
 This is definitely a book that touches you, and makes you want to be a better person from reading it. To see the characters act nobly despite their shortcomings and mistakes and completely normal and human feelings . . . makes me think that anyone can be a noble, kind person even in the small, everyday things in their life, and especially in the big moments. These characters had some big moments where they stepped up and were great.

 Kitap bayagi elimde surundu kabul ama hem Ingilizce olarak okuyordum hem de bir turlu elime alamiyordum. Wonder tam anlamiyla bitirdigim tek Ingilizce kitap. Dili fazlasiyla basit. Zaten 10 yasindaki cocuklarin agzindan okuyoruz kitabi o yuzden cumleler cok basit. 
 Kisaca konusuna deginirsek; Auggie 10 yasinda ve dogustan yuzunde fiziksel bozukluklar var. Bu yuzden okula hic gitmemis ve evde annesi tarafindan egitim gormus. Ailesi artik besinci sinifa geldigi icin onu okula yazdirmak ister ama Auggie buna karsi cikar. Daha sonradan bir sekilde okula gitmeyi kabul eder. Ve kitabi ilk basta Auggie'nun acisindan okusak da sonradan okuldaki ve ailesinden olan kisilerin bakis acilarindan da okuyoruz. 
 Bolum bolum herkesin bakis acisini okumak gercekten keyif vericiydi.(Auggie'nin ablasi Via, Via'nin sevgilisi Justin, Auggie'nin okuldan arkadaslari Jack ve Summer ve Via'nin arkadasi Miranda) Herkesin Auggie hakkinda ne dusundugunu ve ne hissettigini okumak kitabi sevmemde buyuk etken. Sadece Auggie tarafindan aktarilsaydi bazi seyler tam olmayacakti. Belki de diger karakterlere bakis acimiz degisecekti ve onlara onyargiyla yaklasacaktik. Yazarin bize farkli bakis acilarini sunmasi kitabi tekduzelikten uzaklastirmis. Kitabi sikicilastirmayip canlandirmis. Ilk baslarda dram agirlikli bir kitap olur diye dusunmustum ama Auggie'nun neseli ve eglenceli hallerini gordukce oyle olmadigini anladim. 
 Auggie'nin daha 10 yasinda insanlar tarafinda sirf yuzu siradisi diye tepkiler gormesi ve onun hissettiklerini okumak hem uzucuydu hem de bir yonden ders vericiydi. Genel olarak insanlarin dis gorunuslerine bakip onlari yargilayan bir toplumuz. Bu kitabi okudugunuz zaman iste bu dusuncelerden tamamiyle ariniyorsunuz, ders aliyorsunuz. Dis gorunusun sadece bir hiclikten ibaret oldugunu goruyorsunuz. Auggie'nin hissettiklerini okumak beni cok etkiledi. Sadece 10 yasinda.10! Ve oylesine saf ve temiz duygulari olan bir cocuk ki artik bir sure sonra insanlarin onun yuzunu gordugunde attiklari cigliklari gormezden gelebiliyor. 
 Kitapta ilk baslarda Auggie'nin okula adapte olmaya calismasini ve insanlarin ona bir virusmus gibi davranmasini okuyoruz.Ve o umutsuz bir sekilde tek basinayken Summer onun yanina geliyor. Summer karakteri o kadar tatliydi ki en sevdigim karakterlerden diyebilirim. Zaman ilerledikce ikisinin dostluklarini okuyoruz. Fazla minnoslar. Cool beans! Ve tabiki Jack'i de en basindan beri sevdim. 
 Auggie'nin bolumleri kadar Via'nin bolumlerini de sevdim. Ailesinin surekli Auggie ile ilgilenmesi ve Via'nin ilgiden yoksun kalmasina ragmen kardesine hic kizamamasi. Bir taraftan liseye baslamasi bir taraftan arkadas sorunsallari derken ilgiye en muhtac oldugu anlarda ilgisiz kalmasi ve yazarin onun hissettiklerini cok iyi sekilde vermis olmasi cok gercekciydi. Gelelim Auggie'nin ailesine. Auggie dogdugu ilk andan beri onlarin ""mucizesi"". Aile baglari simsikiydi ve gayet neseli bir ailesi vardi. 
 Kitap fazla gercekciydi. Okuyan herkesin ders cikaracagi, dostluk, sevgi, nezaketin ne demek oldugunu bu kitapta goreceksiniz. Ve tabiki onyargilarinizi kiracaksiniz.Bol bol duygu karmasalari yaratan bir kitap. Bir bolumde uzuluyorsunuz sonra bir bakiyorsunuz Auggie yine yuzunuzu gulumsetiyor. Bazen de cevredeki insanlara sinirleniyorsunuz. Fazlasiyla duygu yogunlugu olan ama bir o kadarda akici olan bir kitap. 
 Sonlara dogru sanki olaylar gercekciligini yitirdi gibi. Bazi karakterlerin degisimlerinden dolayi sanirim ben oyle hissettim. Bu yuzden hafif hayal kirikligina ugramadim degil. Bunun disinda kesinlikle muazzam farkindalik yaratacak bir kitap. Yasiniz ne olursa olsun alin okuyun.

 Ten year old August Pullman was born with a severe facial deformity. Due to his many surgeries and constant health concerns, Auggie has always been home schooled. So when his mom thinks it's time for him to go to a public school, he is shocked and extremely nervous. How will the kids treat him? Will he make any friends? Will this be a disaster of decision? 
 The story is told from different perspectives and I really felt like I went on this emotional journey with Auggie and his friends and family.

There is much sadness here, but also lots of humour. Eventually compassion wins through and there are a few surprises. 
 It's a great story for teenagers and hopefully will make them think about their actions and prejudices, but I don't think I'll be reading any more novels for this age group any day soon.

 Review: 
 Alienation is not a new theme in literature, much less so in YA fiction. The story of August Pullman, however, is as refreshing as it is familiar. Auggie (as his friends and family call him) was born with a startling cocktail of disorders that left his face so deformed it makes small children cry. As August himself puts it, ""whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse"" (p.3). His uniqueness is purely physical, but it brings with it a whole host of social consequences, especially when August starts middle school. Having been homeschooled his whole life, Auggie's mom, dad, and sister, Via, were able to protect him. Now, the reality of the world, of school life in upper Manhattan is a reality for Auggie too. Bullies and friends, betrayals and ambiguities, Auggie navigates them all with a genuineness that endears him to the reader. Wonder is a novel about middle school which, in its spare prose, avoids feeling juvenile. The narration passes between the main character and five others who orbit him to greater or lesser degrees. Interestingly, all the narrators are children; no adults give a perspective on August. Despite this variety of perspectives, the story remains tightly told, never straying too far from Auggie's evolution. The ending to somewhat too pat, but is also as uplifting as the book deserves. Although Palacio doesn't run from the realities of bullying, she never lets her characters descend so far into the darkness that they can't return safely (though not unchanged). In the end, the book is a hopeful message to the bullied and those who love them. Highly recommended.","Wed Feb 20 06:34:19 -0800 2013","Wed Apr 10 10:04:57 -0700 2013","Tue Apr 09 06:25:45 -0700 2013","Fri Mar 29 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,0,"False"

I didn't feel like this was a book that I would have to store for my future children one day, or recommend to my school library, or choose it as a book to study with a class of students. 
 Spruked throughout the book were some very cliche messages on kindness. Also touched on in the book was the idea of transitioning from childhood to adulthood and how that may mean you can't do fun kiddy things anymore because you are trying so hard to fit in and be an adult too early in life - which is a bit sad. While these are important messages, there was definitely nothing new or inspirational from this story. 
 Having said that, the writing was not completely dreadful. This was a readable book, it was just pretty boring and predictable in terms of characters, plot, complications and themes.","Thu Jun 22 04:04:20 -0700 2017","Sun Jun 25 17:55:08 -0700 2017","Sat Jun 24 19:25:34 -0700 2017","Thu Jun 22 04:04:21 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

 There was a time a few years ago when I was hearing mass with my family, and I happened to stand beside this man at church. The man wasn't dressed the way other people were dressed during Sunday mass. He looked scruffy, almost like he came straight from the streets to the church. He didn't look dangerous, and perhaps he even is nice given that he was in church and all. But what I really noticed were his hands. They were, if I were to be perfectly honest, kind of scary. The memory's vague, but I remember that it looked like he had some kind of skin disease -- lesions, wounds and spots -- the kind that one would refuse to touch in fear of contagion. I was afraid to touch it, knowing especially that at a certain part of the mass, I would have to hold his hand while praying The Lord's Prayer. 
 I tried, I really did. I was in church, and holding hands with a stranger during a prayer is the thing to do. It was the good thing, the kind thing, the loving thing. It was expected. I told myself that I would do it, that I would hold his hand during The Lord's Prayer and not be scared or repulsed or look for a hand sanitizer after the prayer. I told myself, I prepared myself and I wanted to do it. 
 But I didn't. When the priest told everyone to ""join hands and as one family pray the prayer Jesus had taught us,"" I chickened out, opened my hand but did not take his, looked ahead and prayed, feeling the guilt grow heavier as the mass went on. 
 This particular memory may seem insignificant and well, I may be blowing things out of proportion. Perhaps the man never even noticed me at all -- but it struck me because I really wanted to do the kind thing, but I didn't because I was afraid. Just like how the other kids and grown ups in the book reacted to Auggie in Wonder by R.J. Palacio. August Pullman was born with a facial deformity that made him quite special to his family for his need of extra care. He has never attended a normal school, until he agreed with his parents to start attending fifth grade at Beecher Prep. Auggie is a perfect fit for the school, except maybe for his face. Told in Auggie's point of view as well as five more from the people around him, we follow Auggie as he faces one of the most challenging times of his young life. 
 I was prepared for a barrage of emotions that Wonder could probably give me, after reading several reviews and updates from Goodreads friends about this book. I knew that I was probably going to like it, but what I wasn't prepared for were what kind of emotions it would bring. Being a middle grade book, the writing was pretty simple and easy to read, especially since most of the narrators were kids as well. Wonder is bound to remind readers of their own middle school (or in my case, late elementary years, since we do not have middle school in the Philippines) experiences. It's strange to think of it, but young people can be very mean, even if it's not on purpose, and Wonder shows how it could be. My heart went out for Auggie, especially since he did not ask to look like the way he does. Like his parents, I wanted the best for him too. 
 The story was told not just in Auggie's point of view, but also with five other kids who surrounded Auggie's life. This made the book a little easier to relate to because let's admit it: most of us don't have what Auggie has. Of all the characters, I identified the most with his friend, Jack. I really wish I could be like Summer, that I could choose to be kind before anything else. I think Jack represents the side of everyone who tries to be good but fails, and then tries again anyway. And I think the trying is the most important part of it all. 
 There's a lot of buzz with what Wonder teaches, or attempts to teach, but I think maybe we shouldn't over think it too much. Sure, there are some parts that may seem a little simple, that the ending may seem to be a little too nicely wrapped up, almost like how a movie is done and we know real life is never that way. I see it as a simple thing: I see Wonder as a middle grade book that teaches kindness -- to quote, ""...to be kinder than necessary."" That as human beings, we do not just have ""...the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness..."" and to choose that even when it's not easy, when it's inconvenient, even when it's uncomfortable. 
 Even though reading Wonder reminded me of that particular incident I shared at the start of this review which brought back some of the guilty feelings, this book made me feel a lot better after reading it. A little bit more whole, even. With a stronger resolve to be kinder than necessary. I think that a book that can make its readers feel like that is worth a second glance.","Thu Feb 23 10:11:33 -0800 2012","Tue Dec 17 11:18:46 -0800 2013","Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 -0800 2012",51,5,"False"

I read it all in one sitting in just a few hours because I couldn't put it down, and wow did this author nail the middle school experience right on the head. 
 The premise of the book is that a 5th grader named August who was born with a really rare gene defect that caused a lot of problems with his face is about to go to school for the first time (because of health issues he was homeschooled up to that point). I expected the book to follow the trope of kid-who-is-different-is-mistreated-but-comes-out-stronger-and-shows-everyone-he's-awesome, and to some extent I guess it does, but it is SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. 
 So often these types of stories fall flat in some way because the parents or teachers or background characters are two-dimensional and hardly change expect for when it's convenient for the storyline. This book had NONE of those problems. The parents were fleshed out, complex, realistic people who's reactions were consistent with their characters. The teachers and school officials you met felt like they had actual backstories and personalities, and their dialogue wasn't dopey or cartoonish. August's classmates (and his sister Via's high school classmates as well) had convoluted and shifting social dynamics that rang true to my experience as a middle schooler (despite the pop culture and tech differences that made it clear these were 2013ish fifth graders not 2005ish like myself), and none of the kids felt exaggerated or like they existed solely for the sake of August's narrative. The background kids also never felt like one giant mass made up of clones who didn't have their own lives unaffected by the protagonist and antagonist. They all had a place and were nuanced. The bullies were not stupid or inherently evil, nor did they never develop. 
 Most importantly, time and time again Palacio reminded us that the truth resists simplicity. Every time you thought you could pin-point who the ""bad guys"" were going to be, Palacio would smack you in the face with reality and remind you that labeling is not that simple in real life. She reminds us that these school environments are far from static, and that every child affects that, not just the protagonist and antagonist. She reminds us that even though kids can be cruel, they can also be incredibly kind, (or both at once) and they're all complex humans who constantly choose every day whether or not to follow the crowd. 
 The last thing I'll say is that range of view points were interwoven beautifully, and made me empathize and love each speaker. By the end of the book, you feel like you've seen the full picture, and you love every bit of it. The inspiring ending felt earned and honest, and is one of those ""I believe in humans again"" moments. 
 Anyone 5th grade to adult can love and relate to this book and I'd highly recommend it.","Fri Jan 17 09:42:03 -0800 2014","Fri Jan 17 10:53:51 -0800 2014","Fri Jan 17 10:53:51 -0800 2014","",0,0,"False"

 If you want a break from action-packed novels where characters are always on the run for their lives, and you want a light read while looking for a bit of inspiration, Wonder could definitely work. 
 You'll finish reading this book feeling proud. It's very fulfilling. 
 P.S. There's also an appendix I'm sure you'll love. You'd want to frame all the precepts! (You'll know what I'm talking about when you get there) 
 Review 
 First of all, I just love the book cover. It's intriguing, minimalist yet loud, truly creative, and iconic. There's so much to say! I was hooked from the first chapter until the end. It was bittersweet, it was adorable, and it was light and dramatic at the same time. 
 In this novel we get to witness August Pullman, who has craniofacial dysostosis, get through the 5th grade at Beecher Prep middle school. 
 August is such an endearing character. He is only 10 years old, but there is a great maturity about him. He is analytical and observant, and even though he sometimes thinks his situation is unfair, he does not let this thinking get to him. He's optimistic, always cracking up on other's stories even if he is the butt of it. He has his fears but he listens to advise and acknowledges them if they're right (even if he doesn't want them to be right). August described this ""laughing-crying"" situation and that's exactly where his bravery led me. 
 We also get to see that August won't be the only one learning. The people around him change as well, and they change for the better - Via learned to be selfless since the beginning, Summer and Jack becoming true friends despite their schoolmates' oppressive advances, Miranda realizing she didn't have to pretend to get anyone's approval, Miles, Amos, Henry, for standing up to what was right, and August even got Justin to ponder about the universe. 
 I also loved how the book was written. The chapters are short and the titles are concise and straight-to-the-point. It's like I'm reading diary entries from these kids which makes it even more personal. 
 More on the Characters 
 Via 
 There was a point when Via thought August needed to grow up. I can understand that. She observes August pretending he is normal but she doesn't believe it's working nor will it ever work. To her and everyone else August is far from normal than anyone could describe. 
 To hell with that, I say. What August thinks matters more than anyone's judgement. And he's 10 years old, still too young. Besides, August has been handling his life with poise and dignity where a lot of older people fail. 
 Summer 
 He's just a kid. The weirdest-looking kid I've ever seen, yes. But just a kid 
 Everyone should be like Summer. She's compassionate, honest, and kind. She's such a strong character. No one should be treated differently just because of an unconventional appearance. She realizes this and goes out of her way to treat everyone equally. 
 Jack 
 Can I just say that the excerpt on 'Part Four: Jack' was really fitting. 
 Now here is my secret. It is very simple. 
 It is only with one's heart that one can see clearly. 
 What is essential is invisible to the eye. 
 - Antoine de Saint-Exupery, The Little Prince 
 Miranda 
 She said it. When she changed she felt fake. But I understand she was just lost. 
 August 
 He keeps believing he is like everybody else because it's what he wants himself to believe, no matter what anybody else thinks. I think there's a beautiful humility to this thinking. His situation isn't ordinary, in fact it's been mentioned more than once that he's a medical wonder, he gets stared at, whispered at, sometimes outright bullied, yet his heart feels he isn't more special than anyone else. He sucks it up, thinks for a while about anything that transpired, he doesn't ignore his hurt feelings but gets over them and he goes on with his life. After all, we all overcometh the world 
 LOVE THIS PART 
 #JustinAndTheUniverse 
 ""No, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. And the universe doesn't. It takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. Like with parents who adore you blindly. And a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. And a little gravelly-voiced kid whose friends have left him over you. And even a pink-haired girl who carries your picture in her wallet. Maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. The universe takes care of all its birds.""

She writes very well for the most part, getting us inside the heads of various characters; however, I would have liked to see Julian's or his friends' points of view. An emotionally moving book, my few criticisms are that I felt she overused the word 'dude,' I found that the story dragged near the end in a few spots, and I kept thinking as Auggie's classmates started jumping in to get their picture taken with him that many of them still weren't his friends, but we're just jumping on the bandwagon. I've also never heard of anyone graduating from fifth grade or any other grade where you don't actually leave the school. That seemed weird to me.

 Wow. This book has shaken up my world. Awoken me from a deep slumber. It's like I'm seeing life from brand new eyes. Not only Auggie's story, but Summer's, Miranda's, Olivia's, Justin's and Jack's story all made me reflect about... everything. Made me question countless things in life. Helped me realize how much I have to be thankful for and how sometimes this world might get a bit too hard. But it's not about who has it the worst, it's about what we do to overcome our obstacles and become better people because of it. 
 This book is inspiring, memorable and it ignited a fire inside me I thought had perished long ago. Truly a master piece. Just by thinking of Auggie and everything he (and I) went through in this book, I feel braver, stronger and more capable of facing tomorrow's trials. So thank you Auggie. Thank you Via.

I was already about 100 pages in and expected to be with Auggie the entire book when all of a sudden we were reading Via, and it threw me off a bit. I really didn't love her POV, and I thought it was just that I wasn't into the POV switch, but once her part ended and we reached Summer's POV things picked up again. Which really upset me, because I think Via's perspective could have been really important. I loved the other POV's, but for whatever reason Via's voice fell really flat, and the things she talked about didn't really add much to the story for me, which was disappointing. I think it could have been really great for the story, but it just didn't hit the mark. That being said, I did love this book. There were major problems with execution, but I adored the overall idea of the story. Auggie just touched my heart, and this book really did elicit so many emotions from me.

 I experienced several emotions as I was reading this book; from anger to sadness and then felt happy for a second and back to sadness. This book is about acceptance, friendship, and love. This book is simple and it doesn't have many plot twists yet it's still a very touching book. 
 The book is basically about August's life and how he struggles with school, in society and to make friends. August was born with an ""extraordinary"" face and he was homeschooled until one day his parents decided to put him into a regular school. The plot basically takes off from there. 
 It is also interesting that there are more than 3 POV in this book; from August himself, his sister, his sister's boyfriend, and his friends. This allows us to experience different feelings and emotions toward August and they're all relatable :)

 SPOILER: 
 Daisy's death and the cheese touch brought tears to my eyes. 
 August calls himself freak and orc among other things but I wanted to see a change--some growth. I also feel like he remained weak throughout. When will everyone realize August is as human as they are? This could have happened the moment he lost his hearing aids. I also feel the writing gets too clinical--re: Via's perspective on August'medical background. 
 This story needed something more to make the main character (August) a well-rounded individual. On one hand he's self-loathing but when does he see himself as more than just a person with a rare deformity? Yes, all these bad things happen to him but as a reader, I wanted everyone in the book to stop treating him like a victim and to realize that it doesn't matter if you are deformed, everyone has challenges. When does the silver lining stir some positivity in his life and provide strength? Where is the beauty beyond what he perceives?

 Told from various points of view, readers take a journey with ten-year-old Auggie (real name August) as he journeys to school for the first time. Born with facial disfigurement, Auggie is prepared for people to stare at him, but school turns out to be harder than expected---not just for Auggie but for his family and friends. 
 What I find amazing is that the author captures so many different characters perfectly: their voice, their feelings, their background. Each character is unique and adds to Auggie's story while telling their own. 
 Add them all together, and you get a beautiful story of friendship and triumph and, most of all, acceptance. 
 I'm going to promote this book heavily at school this coming year and encourage teachers to use it in their classrooms.

 Eleven-year old August ""Auggie"" Pullman has a genetic defect that makes his face look like Darth Sidious after he gets burned by Sith lightning, and boy does he know it. 
 Rat boy. Freak. Monster. Freddy Krueger. E.T. Gross-out. Lizard face. Mutant. I know the names they call me. I've been in enough playgrounds to know kids can be mean. I know. I know. I know. 
 All he wants is to be an ordinary kid and that just isn't in the cards for him, but now he's 11 and his parents have decided that it's time for him to leave homeschooling and enter the fifth grade at Beecher Prep. 
 The book is told in first person first by Auggie, then his sister Via, his friends Summer and Jack, Via's boyfriend Justin, and Via's friend Miranda. (I do wish Julian's voice had been included.) The voices are so individual and so convincing that sometimes you forget this book was written by an adult. The texts between Auggie and Jack (and Jack's letters of apology) after the big fight are just priceless 
 Auggie: wud u really wan to kill urself if u wer me??? 
 Jack: no!!!!! I swear on my life but dude--I would want 2 kill myself if I were Julian :) 
 Auggie: lol yes dude we'r frenz agen. 
 Auggie is different, he is other, it's not something he can hide and it's not something anyone can ignore, and this whole book is pretty much a teachable moment whose message could be distilled into two words: Be kind. People behave badly at Halloween 
 I'd been talking to Julian about August. Oh man. Now I understood! I was so mean. I don't even know why. I'm not even sure what I said, but it was bad. It was only a minute or two. It's just that I knew Julian and everybody thought I was so weird for hanging out with August all the time, and I felt stupid. And I don't know why I said that stuff. I just was going along. I was stupid. I am stupid. 
 and with the plague and the shunning and at the nature retreat but the effort to ostracize and demonize Auggie fails utterly in the end. It's partly because of Auggie himself, who all he wants to be is ordinary and is anything but. It's partly because the staff and teachers of the school and some of the parents lead by example. But mostly it's because of the kids' own innate goodness. Maybe they didn't know it was there before they met Auggie but they know it now. (Although one of my book club members with a vision-impaired child who was picked on a lot in school was more than a little skeptical about just how good these kids are.) 
 Palacio saves the best for last with the Postcard Precepts. Milo's is so great, Julian's hints that he may have learned something more than his mother wanted him to this year, and of course, Auggie's 
 Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world. 
 Auggie sure did, with a little help from his family and friends. And I would like to have seen that production of Our Town. Highly recommended, with Kleenex. 
 One quibble: According to the author's acknowledgements this book was inspired by a girl she met in front of an ice cream store. Why isn't Auggie a girl? Why do the writers of childrens' books continue to favor male characters? It's like Katniss Everdeen never existed. The 5th grade teacher in my book club said, ""But Dana, you can't get boys to read books about girls"" and I said, ""I've been hearing that since I was a kid. If writers and publishers--and teachers--keep catering to boy readers nothing will ever change."" If girl readers are force marched through books about boys it seems only fair that boys should be force marched through books about girls. And I have made grown men read The Hunger Games, so what is the big damn deal here???","Tue Sep 13 09:56:29 -0700 2016","Thu Dec 29 20:52:01 -0800 2016","Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 -0700 2016",7,5,""

 The story is told from various points of view, the main one being August the terribly disfigured boy who's sweetness of nature seems almost too good to be true at times. There are also sections written from his sister's point of view of the same events, and her boyfriend, and August's best friend at school. 
 I thought the writer totally nailed the language and tensions of an elementary school environment, the bullying the ostracizing, the knitting together of friendships and the feelings of the people involved. I could feel for them all, and the fact that peoples' actions were not necessarily for the presumed reason, was a valuable lesson, without being at all ""preachy."" In short, it was a great read, an easy read as it was mainly told from childrens' point of view, but no less profound for that. Some would probably argue that it was all tied together too neatly, with a nice bow at the end to make it pretty, but you could tell that August's transition into high school would not be easy, however lovely things turned out at the end of 5th grade. It was just the first chapter of his challenging life, but an ultimately triumphant one.","Thu Mar 14 05:09:48 -0700 2013","Thu Mar 14 05:17:31 -0700 2013","Tue Mar 12 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,""

 So you might well ask, why only three stars? For starters, this is precisely, the kind of book that is really not that difficult to write. Now the author writes well and has a keen sense of humour, but writing this wouldn't/couldn't really be much of a challenge for obvious reasons. Secondly, 'kindness' is oversold over 'self dignity' and that makes this book a tad preachy. I could cite a coupla other reasons but minor quibbles do not really take too much away from the sheer 'feel good' factor that the book manages to evoke in you.

 I avoided this book for nine months, because I knew it was an Issue book--further, one that had a Beloved Dog as well as the issue, in this case a boy born with a rare genetic marker that resolves into severe facial distortion.

 Auggie Pullman won't make you weep out of pity but of awe. The characters are all well-written and have real life sentiments and emotions. It inspires and challenges readers to stay true, have courage and to always choose kind. Can't reiterate enough.

 August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school - until now. He's about to enter fifth grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid, then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances? 
 My reactions 
 This is a wonderful debut novel dealing with bullying and courage. Auggie is an endearing 10-year-old, who, despite his extraordinary face, is really just an ordinary kid; he likes ice cream, riding his bike, Star Wars, and his X-Box. But he's been sheltered at home and doesn't have all the social skills he needs to navigate the ""deep-end-of-the pool"" that middle school represents. Still, he's courageous, resourceful, and knows he can rely on at least one friend who has seen past his face to the find the great kid that he is. 
 The novel is told from various perspectives. We hear from Auggie, his older sister Via, her boyfriend Justin, and Auggie's friends Jack and Summer. There are scenes that broke my heart and made me want to jump into the pages of the book to hug Auggie and assure him that things would get better. There are scenes that had me cheering for Auggie and Jack as they took a stand. The ultimate message is clear: We should all strive to be kinder than necessary. It is also uplifting: Everyone in the world should have a standing ovation at least once in their lives. 
 A couple of things in the story did bother me. No adult stepped in to stop the bullying. Yes, I realize that Auggie and his friends refused to go to any adult to report what was happening, but it's clear by the end of the novel that at least one adult recognized the pattern of behavior, and apparently did nothing. I was also bothered by Via's troubles as she also found herself an outsider in a new school. Parents that were portrayed as sensitive and nurturing seemed to not notice at all that their daughter was struggling and so very unhappy. There were times when I felt worse for Via than for Auggie. 
 But this is a book written for a middle-school audience and I think the message is one that is empowering to children. You can choose to be nice despite how others treat you, and your worth is not dependent on how popular you are, or on who finds you attractive. Important precepts for all of us to adopt.","Sun Jun 01 12:38:39 -0700 2014","Sun Jun 01 12:39:55 -0700 2014","Sat May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2014","",4,0,"False"

Yeah, I just picked it up and started reading. But for last few days when I saw a lot of people adding it, I felt like I should also express my feelings about this book. 
 Wonder is story of a 10 years old wonder boy named Auggie. Why is he a wonder boy? Because he showed the boldness that many of us cannot even think of! 
 Nowadays people are always so wary about their looks, which has almost built up a common conception that appearance is everything. If you don't look good, you are not fit for the society. 
 Obtuse people with their absurd hypothesis! 
 Auggie's face was deformed due to some facial disorder. So, he looked a bit different from other kids. And this made his life almost unbearable! He used to be homeschooled by his mom until he started his 5th grade in a local school. 
 New place, new people, new experiences.....For Auggie, everything seemed quite unfriendly and this was supposed to be happen in a society with those so called appearance theory! 
 A 10 years old, getting a creepy look from everyone around him is not a very pleasing scenario. So Auggie was really upset. And he was devastated when he finds out that the boy, who was pretending to be his friend, is actually badmouthing about his appearance to others. This leaves him in tears. 
 But he copes up with everything, makes new friends, actual friends and some incidents make the people around him to believe that he is like everyone else. 
 Well, yeah, it ends like a fairy tale because people love stories with happy endings. But in real life the picture can be somehow different. 
 Although, its' genre is middle grade or young adult or children, it is a perfect book for everyone. I believe after reading this book, everyone one of us will feel bad for any kind of criticism ever made by us on someone's appearance. 
 Wrapping up the review with a quote from this book which I really love- 
 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 Indeed! A little appreciation to others won't do any harm to you. So, I never felt being a miser in appreciating people! ^_^","Fri Aug 19 00:57:46 -0700 2016","Thu Dec 01 07:39:48 -0800 2016","","",15,0,""

 Veredicto: Me gusto. 
 Pero no se, siento que falto algo, el final me parecio de lo mas....no puedo decir tonto porque no lo es, y tampoco apresurado porque es un buen final pero... 
 Ok, mejor empecemos con las cosas que me gustaron: los personajes. 
 El libro se divide en 8 partes, y cada parte es narrada por un diferente personaje, eso hace que el libro no se vuelva aburrido bueno menos la ultima parte que sinceramente no la soporte , los personajes que mas me gustan fueron Via (que es la hermana de Auggie) y Summer. 
 Pero tambien habia personajes que no entiendo el porque se narraba desde su punto de vista, ejemplo: el novio de Via. 
 A lo largo del libro hay varios problemas con diferentes personajes, y algunos de estos, me parecieron que en ningun momento del libro se resolvieron y otros que se resolvieron de manera muy tonta. 
 Sin embargo, lo recomiendo :) 
 ...oh, por cierto me ha encantado de que autora se la pace citando canciones o libros al comienzo de algunas partes del libro.

 Where do I even begin with a book that has quite possibly managed to change all of my feelings towards books just by reading it? When I requested Wonder from NetGalley, I thought that I was going to read it and end up enjoying it since the few people I know have given it good reviews. I never, ever expected that I was going to fall in love with this book the way that I did. Not only did Wonder give me the chance to reflect on the way that I think about certain aspects of life, but it also made me laugh and cry from happiness and sadness and all the -nesses in between. 
 Ten-year-old August has been through more in his life than half a dozen people and he's still going strong. Suffering from a chromosome deficiency, he was born with severe facial disfiguration that twenty-seven surgeries hasn't managed to fix. His parents finally decide that August should go to school, and enroll him in a private school where the principal has three other kids who've volunteered to help him adjust and watch out for him. 
 This book is definitely listed as one of my favourite reads of 2012. Probably the absolute favourite, right up there with The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. I stayed up until 6am to try and finish Wonder, and was so disappointed that sleep needed to take priority to reading. Reading about Auggie's life through his point of view as well as others' (his sister, Via, his best friend, Summer, his other best friend, Jack, Via's beau, Justin, and Via's best friend, Miranda) gave me the chance to fall in love with, not only the plot, but each and every character just because I got a chance to see how they interacted in the life of Auggie and his family. 
 My favourite person (but least favourite point of view, unfortunately) was Via's boyfriend's, Justin. While I really disliked the way that Justin's part was written in the same aspect of David Levithan's Will Grayson (worse, actually, because I wasn't sure where the characters were speaking at some points) I really enjoyed the way that he had with words, and the feelings that he had for Oliva were the most beautiful in the world. I found myself wanting to cry a little bit when I reached the end of his part, when he said: 
 ""olivia reminds me of a bird sometimes, how her feathers get all ruffled when she's mad. and when she's fragile like this, she's a little lost bird looking for its nest. so i give her my wings to hide under."" 
 I know the focus of the story really isn't about Via, but I really, really liked the way that her character was written. She was so understanding and protective of her brother, where most teenagers would have been somewhat selfish in that aspect. She never asked for anything, never tried to have her wants and needs taken care of first. She put everything aside for Auggie, and I found that to be the best part of the novel. Even though the focus of Wonder was on August, I found myself loving Via most when it came to the characterisations. 
 Speaking of August, that boy... He's amazing. I can't even begin to imagine going through twenty-seven surgeries and then being brave enough to go to school and try and be normal. Being two years younger than everyone else was enough for me to hate school, so I can't even imagine what it must have been like for him. August is such a strong, wonderful boy, and while they mistreated him so much in the beginning of the novel, he grew, as did those who hurt him and those who helped him. I loved seeing the transformation when these kids realised that it wasn't about how their friend looked; it was about who he was as a person. 
 Wonder is a book that will probably always live with me, and I can't imagine a day where I'll find myself completely forgetting that I've ever read it. It's one of those books that touches your soul and makes you realise that there's more to humanity than what's on the surface. If you have this on your to-read list, or even if you don't, stop what you're doing and go pick it up, because I guarantee that by the time you're done reading it, you'll realise just how wonderful Wonder actually is.","Mon Feb 20 13:23:23 -0800 2012","Wed Mar 07 17:04:22 -0800 2012","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 -0800 2012",3,0,"False"

We're inside the mind of a 10 year old boy who is entirely mature for his age and who is surrounded by people who try to avoid reality when he lives in it and understands. He understands that people turn the other way when they look at him, understands the reason why people are mean to him. We also read other people's point of views but it's all associated with August and I absolutely love how much love they share with him and it warms my heart. This book is phenomenal. Absolutely incredible. Just a beautiful, heartwarming, heartbreaking read. It takes you on a whole rollercoaster ride of emotions and I love it when a book affects you so much, and no it's not just a book. It's a voice that is speaking out for those who are afraid to speak out with a condition similar to this.

He was previously homeschooled due to multiple surgeries to try and correct a severe craniofacial abnormality. However, the surgeries haven't done much to fix Auggie's face and he is still a frightening sight to many.

At first I was disappointed when I realized it was changing pov, but then I loved hearing how the events affected different characters in the story. It gave more depth to Auggie's (the main character's) life and experiences. 
 Although it might have a bit too much of a ""happily ever after"" ending, I loved the author's perspective that, ""there are more good people on the earth than bad people, and the good people watch out for each other."" Believing that gives us hope in this crazy world, and maybe inspires each of us to try a little harder to be ""good people"" and have more faith in each other. 
 The only thing I didn't like about the story, was the focus on 10 year old ""dating"". I'm sure it happens in ""the real world"", but 10 year olds are just too immature for relationships and the frequent discussion of it just rubbed me wrong. I got over it, but wish it could have been left out, or at least downplayed a little more. 
 Here's one last favorite quote from the book that sums up the overall message to me: ""...if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God.""

It taught me so many lessons. I simply loved it. Love love love it. This is probably a children book that I enjoyed so much. 
 I especially enjoy being able to see things in August's perspective. The way others treat him like he is special but all along he is as normal as me and you. Also, August is so cute and hilarious! 
 Another thing I love is how we are able to see the story progress from the perspective of all the different characters. This just makes things much more relatable because you might be any one of those other characters. I especially love how great his sister is towards him. She is so understanding, mature and deserves respect. A lot of respect. The flow of the story is just nice. Not too fast. Not too slow. You can just walk through August and his life as he starts school. 
 At the end of the day, the main moral of the story is being kind to one another. Going through the journey with August has reinforced the importance of being kind to others. How everyone treated him as a plague initially and finally being able to accept him and respect him. :')

 My issue is with the Julian chapter in the special edition. Sometimes a bully is just a bully. Sometimes, kids don't have a pattern of irrational fear and night terrors to explain away that mean. Sometimes, there isn't a grandma who can tell a quick story about Nazi occupation and dynamically change a character. Sometimes, bullies are so hurt themselves it takes more than a French vacation to set things right. And sometimes, kids are just mean. I thought this chapter hurt an otherwise strong story.

Although a hearing aid would really help- he doesn't have much of an ear to hang them on, just another obstacle. 
 His Mom thinks going to school would be all around good for Augie. It will also present a huge challenge in day to day courage on Augie's part and day to day acceptance of a visual surprise on the part of his classmates.

He's also very smart and very funny, and he's 10. During the summer he learns that his mother and father have decided that perhaps now he should start school, rather than continuing to be homeschooled. Starting fifth grade at Beecher Prep will be a challenge in more ways than one, as his looks make the initial ""getting to know you"" part difficult, plus the idea of learning with others at a set pace? He's not happy. 
 From the beginning, Augie's voice is very real. It's not relentlessly upbeat, it's realistically filled with ups and downs, and his moments of true despair were ones where I, too, would have despaired. The other voices we hear are not always as real, particularly Justin's and Miranda's. Miranda's decisions didn't always make sense (of course, what we day and do as we attempt to reinvent ourselves in a new place aren't always the most thought-out decisions! on the other hand, the play...) and Justin's virtual lack of reaction to Augie just didn't quite seem right. Summer and Jack, on the other hand, were almost as pitch-perfect as Augie. 
 The turning point in Augie's first year of ""real"" school comes as a surprise, and again it seems just a little bit off. Not what happens, but the aftermath back in school and the graduation celebration. 
 Still, those are minor quibbles. Over all, this is a book I'm guessing we'll hear more about during book award season.

 I started reading this book so I would not get told off at school for not having a book to read, so I borrowed it from a friend. Little did I know that later that day I would be sat in the library sobbing into the same book. 
 Not much happened, I'll admit, but the pace of the book was great so I had no trouble getting into it. I love the way it is written. The perspective changes so you get other people's points of view, which really added to the story. When it was just August's viewpoint it was very one sided and you never thought about the feelings and opinions of the other characters because August never thought about them either, or knew what they were thinking. But when it happened it really opened up the story and made it so much bigger.

 La narrativa tiene una simplicidad sincera. Al leerlo se siente que los personajes en verdad te cuentan la historia. En este aspecto me recordo mucho a The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Esta escrito de tal forma que por mas que sea super rapido y simple de leer, tambien esta cargado de emocion. Mientras lo leia, por mas comun que fuese lo que me estaban contando, mi corazon palpitaba sin parar y las lagrimas estaban al borde de escaparseme en cada capitulo. 
 Al principio parecia un libro plenamente normal, pero mientras mas lo leia mas me daba cuenta de lo rapido que uno se encarina con los personajes y sus historias. 
 Al llegar al final, no pude contener las lagrimas. Lagrimas puramente cargadas de felicidad. Este libro volvio a darme una razon para creer en la humanidad y su capacidad de hacer actos bondadosos, algo que en verdad necesitaba.

 Definitely heed the warning on the front about ""sob-making"" (and this from The Wall Street Journal). 
 August was born with serious facial deformities thanks to a perfect storm of the combined genetic mutations from both of his parents. Well, that's nice; one parent can't blame the other. Their concern and love for him, as unswerving as it is, leaves his older sister in a sort of no-man's land. We learn of this family from the various voices of the two children and their friends. August starts school for the first time in fifth grade, when everyone else is starting middle school, at a New York City prep school. His mother had been home-schooling him because of his health and many operations, but has finally reached the limit of her abilities and feels he must finally join the real world. 
 The real world, of course, is populated with real creeps as well as their really creepy parents. I can't believe that a parent would photoshop a child out of her son's class picture for any reason but then I just saw a political flyer where a black woman's face was photoshopped out and replaced with the face of the white woman next to her in line*. So what do I know? 
 At first shunned by his schoolmates in a most believable manner (Oh, yes - I remember the ""Tony Baloney, the ice cream pony"" episode from my own grade school experience), August learns to stand up for himself. But not after discovering that someone he thought was his friend has feet of clay. 
 His sister, Olivia, now in high school has the chance to be not August's sister for the first time since he was born. But for some reason her old friends have rejected her. 
 Okay, it's a children's book, so I have to accept that it's going to end in an upbeat note, even if as an adult I find that unlikely. Fortunately, the upward progress of August's social life is marred by ... 
 spoilerrrrr! 
 the death of the family dog. I have to admit that that came close to making me sob. 
 Now, what did I actually get from this book, since I don't have any facial deformities or even know anyone with any? And, thanks to my childhood, I already knew that some kids were cruel. 
 Well, I think the English teacher's ""precept"" project made me think - especially the ""Your deeds are your monuments"" one. I mean, what have I done in my life? 
 ""This precept means that we should be remembered for the things we do ... The things we do outlast our mortality."" I like to think that my work with children (when I'm not yelling at them or being cross with their parents) is my memorial. Of course, I always tell them that they are free to mention me in the dedication of any book they write or illustrate (and I fully expect that that might actually work one day - hee!), but what I hope that I've managed to get some of them to love books. No one will carve it into a pyramid, I'm not going to get any awards for it, but I had thought it was enough. 
 Now I'm worried about that. What are people's memories of me? y este aplauso que recibe, en el viento se escribe, y en cenizas le convierte la muerte. Shhhhugar. Now I'm all depressed.

In a time where even the slightest bit of difference can render one exiled from social groups, from political discussions, and even from going to the bathroom, it's heartwarming to read a story about a kid who embraces his differences and rises above those who would keep him down. Everyone loves an underdog story and this is a prime example. 
 Wonder is the story of fifth-grader Auggie Pullman. Born with genetic abnormalities that resulted in facial deformities, Auggie has been sheltered by his parents for most of his life. This year promises to be different, as Auggie enters school for the first time. As might be expected, not everything goes as well as his parents have hoped. Although a small group of peers has been chosen to help Auggie acclimate to school life, not everyone's intentions are pure and Auggie is the target of some intense bullying that causes him to question whether school is something he truly wants. Fortunately, some students do magnificently have Auggie's back and they show him what having real friends is like. 
 I was afraid that this would be a simple retelling of the ""it's not how you look, it's what's inside you that counts"" moral. Thankfully, Palacio's writing gives the story far more depth. I was particularly pleased to see that we were privy to viewpoints aside from Auggie's and that not everyone served as Auggie's cheerleader. Most notably was the chapter told from his sister Via's point of view. With Auggie and his needs forming the center of the family, Via is known mostly to others as the deformed boy's sister. Entering high school and enduring changes within her own social circle only complicates Via's life and, despite her love for her brother, Via is sullen and withdrawn. However, instead of vilifying Via, Palacio is sympathetic to her needs and shows how hard these challenges can be for everyone involved. 
 Wonder is billed as a middle-grade novel, but there's much to be taken from it as an adult. As grown-ups we typically know that it's wrong to poke fun of someone who is visibly different from us, yet we continue to bully and ostracize with the best of them. For everyone who is different in some way - whether that is through the clothes one's culture or religion prescribes or through the food one eats due to health restrictions or to the gender with which one identifies - Wonder serves as a hopeful tale of redemption. Likewise, it serves as a reminder to us that we are not all so different, and that kindness goes a long way.","Wed Jun 15 10:10:45 -0700 2016","Fri Dec 09 13:16:33 -0800 2016","Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Wed Jun 15 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,"False"

After being homeschooled for the first several years of his education, he starts fifth grade at Beecher Prep School. Ms. Palacio captures the difficulties of middle school (Beecher Prep is 5th-8th) for ""ordinary"" kids as well as the extra challenges for a person as different on the outside as August is (though he says at the beginning ""I think the only person in the world who realizes how ordinary I am is me.""). 
 I liked how Ms. Palacio traded off narrator duties between main characters like August, his sister Via, and his best friend Jack; and minor characters like his sister's boyfriend Justin and his sister's ex-best friend Miranda. Each of them were able to provide the perfect perspective for the section of the story they told. 
 She also provides gold nuggets of wisdom mixed in with the story. When August doesn't want to go back to school because of a betrayal, his big sister says, ""You have to go back to school. Everyone hates school sometimes. I hate school sometimes. I hate my friends sometimes. That's just life, Auggie. You want to be treated normally, right? This is Normal! We all have to go to school sometimes despite the fact that we have bad days, okay?"" 
 And when Via's boyfriend is mulling over how ""the universe was not kind to auggie pullman"" he concludes (with appropriately emo disregard for capitalization and proper punctuation), ""no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. [several specific examples from auggie's life]...maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds."" 
 From the school principal's graduation talk: ""It's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed...If you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God."" 
 And then Auggie's prescient maxim: ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 I may be too cynical, but I wish I had the confidence that the same happy ending August had would be the result for other kids at other schools, but experience has shown that's not always the case. We can all of us, though, try to be a little kinder and bring reality closer to this beautifully told story.

He was born with a facial anomily. He visits the school and three kids are there to show him around. At lunch summer comes to sit with him. He has a birthday party and 5 people from his class show up. The kids pretend that he has the plague. He loves Halloween but this year he overhears his friend jack talking meanly to Julian the bully. Via, Augusts sister, knows the world revolves around August. Her best friend from middle school has changed now that they are in high school. So she starts to hang out with a different group and meets Justin. Summer got invited to a holloween party but wants to leave shortly after she gets there because it's all drama and they want to set her up with a boy. Summer ends up giving jack a hint at why August isn't talking to him anymore. Jack didn't initially want to be a tour guide for him because he remembers running into him when he was younger with his babysitter. But once he gets to know him he really wants to be Augusts friend. Jack picks up an old sled from the sledding hill and cleans it up. When he is trying to tell his friends about it he realizes that it's one of their sleds and they are saying a hobo took it. He realizes then that he doesn't want to hang out with them anymore. When jack gets paired with August for a science project jack realizes why August is not speaking to him and how mean the things he said were. Julian tries to get to switch projects to be with Jack and jack ends up punching him. Jack apologized to August and they are friends again. There is now an Jack vs Julian war going on that has the class divided. Charlotte clues them in. Jack switches to summer and Augusts lunch table. When jack is over at Augusts they meet Justin, vias boyfriend. Justin and via bond over being in the play our town. One day Justin walks jack to the bus stop and sees Julian picking on him. Later he goes up to them and pretends to be tough and tells them not to mess with Jack. Justin finds out from Miranda that she and via used to be best friends. When he asks via about this she gets defensive and admits she feels guilty because she hadn't told her family about the play. August ends up getting hearing aids and they aren't as bad as he thought they would be. And they help his hearing out a lot. August finds out that via and they fight and August yells at his mom. He runs to his room expecting his mom to follow but she doesn't. A long time later via comes to get him and says that their dog daisy is dying. They have to say goodbye. Via and Justin's play goes amazing. At the last minute Miranda can't play the main role so as her understudy via steps in. At the end August is amazed at the standing ovation. That summer at camp Miranda didn't have a great time. Her parents were getting divorced and she never really got attention from them. She begins to tell people at camp about herself but it's all facts from vias life but it makes her more popular. When she gets back from camp she doesn't call via because she knows that she cares and will ask too many hard questions so it is easier to ignore her and start fresh. So on opening night of the play she has no one there to watch her so she pretends to be sick so via can perform while her family is there. After that she and via make up. August goes on a nature retreat with his school. He is very nervous at first but ends up having a great time. They go to a drive in movie of the sound of music which is vias favorite. The only bad part is when some older kids from another school pick on him but some boys from his class and Jack are around and defend him. He looses his lobot hearing aids though. After this things change at school. People aren't afraid to touch him and they all call him little dude now. When he gets home his family surprised him with a new dog called bear. In the principals office he sees his assignment of drawing a self portrait as an animal. It is a duck and Mr tushman wonders if there is any deeper meaning but August says no. When his dad is dropping him off to graduation it comes out that the astronaut helmet August wore as a child was not lost but was thrown away by his dad. August is mad at first but his dad just wanted to see him and not have him hide. They end up making up. August ends up getting an award for having quiet strength and building up greatness. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and he thinks it's the best thing ever. After, everyone wants their picture with him and he's ok with the camera. Summer and her mom and Jack and his parents and justin go to Augusts house after and they are all having a great time.","Sun Sep 03 15:12:55 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 08 21:36:43 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 07 21:46:55 -0700 2017","Sun Sep 03 15:12:55 -0700 2017",0,0,""

It made you think that nobody is ever perfect and sometimes you have to deal with it. I could not put this book down. I had to read it as a 7th grade reading book assignment for summer. Wonder is a very cute book about a August Pullman who has multiple disabilities and is homeschooled. His mother and father finally make the decision that will change his life forever. They ask him if he wants to go to a public Elementary School where there are kids. His sister is starting high-school, and his parents think it might be a good idea to get him involved and start making friends and come out of his shell. When this young, determined kid and his mother are called in for an appointment to tour the school and visit the principal, August Pullman is very anxious to go and see people. He had never gone to school before and he was worried what people would think of his differences. August had been born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school. He had to have many surgeries but none of them helped him. His parents always supported him and coddled him and made sure he was comfortable and welcome. The principal has called in three experienced 4th graders who are there to help tour the school. They were also there to help August and help him understand Beecher Prep. The kids consisted of 2 boys and 1 girl. The two boys were very different. One of the boys was very generous and seemed to really understand what was going on in August's curious mind. The other boy wasn't friendly at all from the start. He kept on making very rude remarks on August's face. He asked him if he got burnt and those mean things. However, the other boy stood up for him. The girl told him everything he needed to know about this school. She mentioned all the classrooms, the curriculum and the major clubs that were offered at Beecher Prep. As August's goes home, he thinks about what the rude boy had said. August is just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances? 
 If you haven't read this book, I hope this review has convinced you to go and read it because I will guarantee that it is the most wonderful, inspirational book ever. I strongly recommend this book for kids and adults that are scared and worried that someone will judge you because you act, talk, and behave weirdly. We all have out differences and where we stand and at the end of the day we all human beings. Appearances shouldn't be our concern, but how our attitudes are matters. Everyone should have the chance to come out of their shell and feel welcome.","Mon Feb 18 20:53:11 -0800 2013","Mon Feb 18 21:17:09 -0800 2013","Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 -0700 2011","",0,1,""

 ""It's not enough to be friendly. You have to be a friend."" 
 Such a heartbreaking/Heartwarming book! I couldn't stop reading this story and it really made me emotional just thinking about Auggie and his day to day life. I loved the family dynamic and how they didn't make it this ""Too good to be true family"". They all had their flaws and difficulty with Auggie's condition and the author wasn't afraid to shy away from them. 
 I love how the main part of the story was about friendship which is a very important thing especially in middle school and how just one act of kindness can change everything! I constantly felt like jumping in the book and helping Auggie out and that just shows how many children are going through this exact same thing and how the world/society might treat them. It breaks my heart but it's such an important story to be told. 
 There are so many Auggie Pulmans out there waiting for that one act of kindness. 
 The characters in this book were amazing and I was surprised by the different points of views since I had no idea there was going to be different POV's but it helped the story immensely and helped me see the thought process of everyone else. I could see the story play out in my head and I could picture everything perfectly even though at the beginning even Auggie said: 
 ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 I'm so glad Auggie gave school a chance and gave this new life a chance and it shouldn't even be a question in the real world. I think this is a book for anyone big or small and I'll definitely be going to see this movie as soon as it comes out.","Fri Jun 02 16:14:39 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 02 16:35:26 -0700 2017","Mon May 29 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sat May 27 00:00:00 -0700 2017",2,0,""

At the time, they were reading Wonder and after hearing the premise of the book, I decided I'd read it one day. I'm glad I did. The book is entertaining and also has a great message for students about people being different. What I thought was important in the story too, was the fact that all the people connected to August, the main character had issues too. The difference was that their problems were not visible like his. Its a great way to show kids to look past the differences we have, whether it be facial deformity, poverty, or whatever issues we face and look at who the person truly is. 
 This is an easy read. I read it one siting and recommend it for middle schoolers or, really, anyone. I will not lie---a couple of times it put a lump in my throat as I read it. Makes a great discussion for students, your children or just among friends. And, from my understanding, its coming out as a movie too.

 This book was incredible! The writing, the characters, the messages. Everything was fantastic. I teared up so many times throughout this book, both from sadness and from being touched and happy. 
 I love all of these characters! Auggie is such a sweetheart and I love the way he was written. While I cannot truly speak on this, I feel like it was great representation. His character isso sweet and kind, and I love his sense of humor. I also love his parents. While we don't get to see into their head, I feel as if we know them and I really felt for them as having to deal with a child that has the issues that Auggie does. Via was amazing as well. I loved being able to get into the mind of the sister of someone like Auggie. I like that we got to see her struggle with her feelings and acceptance. She seemed very real, and I truly felt for her throughout the book. Also her boyfriend Justin is a sweetheart. 
 Jack and Summer are such great friends! I was really mad at Jack over what happened on Halloween, and so I love that we got to see his side of everything. It doesn't justify what he said, but I can understand it. Being in fifth grade is rough and it can become very important to be popular. Many people in real life make stupid decisions based on this. I'm just happy that Jack was able to recognize his and fix it. He's a good kid who made a stupid mistake, just like Auggie, I can forgive him for it. And I love that Summer was the opposite! Someone who right away said, screw it, I'm going to be friends with who I want to be friends with! 
 I also grew to love the other kids in the school, minus Julian of course. The only person besides Julian that I didn't like was Miranda. I think she seems like a terrible friend, and honestly, nothing she did redeemed her. She's selfish, and even though I feel bad for her, I think Via deserves better. 
 Overall this was an incredible story with an amazing message and I think everyone should read it!

But Auggie is used to this, and knows he is different. After being homeschooled his whole life, Auggie is going to join middle school for the first time and he is going to need all the love he can get from his family and friends for the tough year. 
 It doesn't matter even if you're not into Children's fiction or feel like Contemporary is not your thing, I think everyone should read this book just to give Auggie a chance to inspire you and touch your heart. Yes, it's true. Auggie Pullman is a little boy who can - and will inspire you in a way that could possibly affect your life. 
 The Pullman family consisted of Auggie's loving parents and big sister, Via. They were all very protective of Auggie and were eager to show the world that their little boy was just an ordinary boy with an extraordinary face. And yes, that is quite true. He was an ordinary boy in every aspect excluding his deformities. He played games on his Xbox, he obsessed over Star Wars and he did everything that ordinary kids do. 
 I must marvel at Auggie's courage and bravery. He did hate the idea of school and thought of not going there anymore. And he did go through moments where he wished he didn't have to be so ""ugly"". But he also found the willpower to walk through the gates of his school and kept up with the pointed stares and whispers. He eventually found friends, kept up with his school work, and accepted his differences enough to be able to joke about it at times. 
 The dynamic relationship when it came to the Pullman family was another amazing and beautiful thing about the story. The parents and the big sister supported Auggie and aided him, perfectly aware of the kind of attention Auggie got. I especially feel for Via, who was known often known not for herself, but as the girl with the deformed brother. 
 Miranda was another character that I liked very much. Miranda is the best friend (sort of, I guess) of Auggie's big sister and has always loved Auggie just as a sister would. She was one of the people who saw Auggie as a wonder. 
 This is a very, very realistic story in many ways. One thing I recon I should mention is how the ALL the kids at Auggie's school don't start bullying him or hurting him, and I'm excluding the few people who actually did that. Now you see, those kids were not rude on purpose, but would end up doing things like flinching away from him or staring or not meeting his gaze probably without even realizing it. What more, was that Auggie understood that. 
 Several times, all I wanted to do was hug Auggie and tell him that he is beautiful in a way his deformities could never erase. That he was beautiful because of his humor and bravery and his amazing personality. That he was lovable no matter what. 
 The author's About section mentions that she got inspired to write this novel when she encountered an extraordinary child in front of an ice cream store. Well, miss R.J., you have inspired I - and many others with this beautiful novel of yours.

 I admit it. I have a Costco habit. Last time I was in the Culver City store, I noticed the stack of Wonders at the endcap. I grabbed a copy and put it in my cart. But as I neared the check-out, I decided to save some money and check it out from my library system. I mean, I'm a librarian, right? 
 After waiting a month for my turn on the holds list, I finally got my hands on the book and read it in... oh, about 4 hours. True, the book was way more enjoyable than my other task of assembling Ikea furniture. And I don't think that I would've been so enamored with the book if I wasn't using it as a way to procastinate. 
 Auggie is a likeable protoganist, if a bit too good to be true. Like others have noted, the first person narration changes frequently, but all of the characters are connected to August in some way. I think this keeps the book from being too shallow in its depictions of the players without adding unnecessary length. 
 However, I thought it was a bit cloying at times, particularly the ideas of the precepts. The quotes for each character at the beginning of their narration irked me. I do have to say that I liked the artwork in the chapters - it was the graphic depiction of the faces that drew me into the book in the first place. 
 Via was my favorite character, but the others, particularly Miranda and John Will, confused me with their actions; the motivations seemed odd and half-formed at times. 
 I would totally book talk this piece; it's an easy read and enjoyable. Life-affirming, yes. Life-changing, not so sure.","Wed Jul 24 15:12:41 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 24 15:28:55 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 24 15:28:55 -0700 2013","",0,0,"False"

He has always been homeschooled and is finally going to an actual school. The story follows August's struggle as he attends school and tries to fit in. It's hard to fit in when you're a new student, bit it's even harder to fit in when don't look like everybody else. 
 Wonder is one of my favorite books because it's so inspirational. Most YA books nowadays are all about a young female struggling with something (Tris struggling to hide her Divergence, Katniss struggling to survive, and Hazel struggling with cancer). Wonder is so different because it's not dystopian the (main) narrator is a male. I think that R.J. Palacio wrote this book with many narrators and the main character being a male because she wanted to show that Wonder is different from other books, just like August is different from everybody else. Everybody is different. If we were all the same, life would be so boring because you would never meet new people. I feel like everybody can relate to August, not because of his facial deformities, but because everybody has trouble fitting in. This book is truly inspirational because it tells a story that could actually happen and does happen to people everyday.

This book certainly means well, but I found it maudlin and irritating. I mean, do they have to give him an award for leaving the house and joining society? Also, no thanks to R.J. Palicio for perpetuating the idea that playing D&D in middle school is complete and utter social suicide. My husband, all his friends, my BFF and my 10 year old nephew all appreciate your denigration of their beloved hobby. Ugh.

What a wonderful middle grade book. I don't own the physical copy, but I want to. It's definitely a book everyone should read. I'm giving it a solid 4 stars. The characters will definitely stick with me for awhile. 
 Wonder is about a boy named August Pullman (Auggie), to his friends and family. August was born with an extremely rare birth defect. If I had the book with me I could tell you the very long word for it. Just know it is a facial defect. There is a very good description in the book, but every time I think of Auggie's face I think of Sloth from the Goonies, except on a 10 year old. 
 When we meet Auggie and his family, they are trying to enroll August into a public school. Beecher Prep is just down the street (in walking distance) of August's home and this will be the first time August has EVER went to school. He has been home schooled this whole time. One of the major reasons for home schooling Auggie was because of the scare factor. Before all the surgeries Augusts face was very different. August had to deal with people staring. Some people would openly say rude comments. It got to the point where Olivia's (August's sister) best-friend Miranda stepped in and gave August a space helmet. This was like his security blanket. He never left the house without it. 
 Back to Beecher prep. August decides he does want to go to school and he is enrolled into the 5th grade. We spend all of 5th grade with Auggie. During the good and the bad. We meet his friends. We see how August deals with bullies and feeling like an outsider. We also get to see other people's point of view. This book has many POV's from Auggie to his sister Via, to Jack his best friend. 
 There were many times I got teary eyed reading and listening to this book. Truly inspiring. If you are looking for a heart-warming story of a boy over coming adversity this is the one to pick up.","Thu Apr 27 20:08:06 -0700 2017","Thu Apr 27 20:58:10 -0700 2017","Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016",9,1,""

Wonder is one of those books that, perhaps despite its flaws, will definitely stick with you. The main character, Auggie, is a lovable hero. The reader finds themselves falling in love with him even as the children at his school do. 
 But, and perhaps I am too cynical, this was one of the main issues I had with the book. Everything seems to eventually come up roses for the main character. I guess I felt like there might have been a place for more conflict. Then again, I realize this is a middle grade book and aimed at children of that age range. More meanness or stronger conflict may have seemed out of place, even if perhaps more realistic. The message certainly would not have been as clear. 
 This is why, despite feeling that at times it was not as realistic as I would've liked, I decided to go with a four star rating for this book. I think the book serves two purposes. The first is to tell a compelling story, which it does. The second, and perhaps more important goal, is to help people walk in the main character shoes for a little while. It may not have been the most perfectly written book I ever read, but I also think it succeeds in this second goal as well.","Sun Jan 19 21:44:11 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 19 21:49:01 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 19 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",0,0,""

 August: ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 I absolutely love Palacio's choice to not describe Augie's face in detail until about 90 pages in during Via's point of view. In this way, the reader gets to do something the characters don't - we get to know Augie without making judgements about how he looks. And you have to love Augie. I also love the switch to other viewpoints - especially, as other reviwers have pointed out, the glimpse into the minds of some of the ""villians"" so we know exactly what was going on and why they made some of the choices they made- another reason this would be an amazing classroom read. 
 I hesitate to say it about an otherwise great read, but I did feel everything was tied up a litle too neatly in the end, but I can let that slide for middle grade when I enjoy the characterization and plotting so much otherwise.

 From the first page of R.J. Palacio's debut novel, Wonder, readers are rooting for Auggie Pullman, who due to the 27 surgeries needed to help correct his craniofacial abnormalities, has been homeschooled all his life. But now, he'll enter the middle school at Beecher Prep, like a lamb headed for slaughter. 
 Auggie is keenly aware of how people react to his face, from averting their eyes to staring to talking behind their hands about him. Auggie, his parents and his sister had created some level of comfort on their block and in their normal routine, and even through things like a toy astronaut's helmet he wore everywhere when he was a few years younger. But now it is time to face the world, and readers come along for the journey. 
 Although Auggie is a character that induces a great deal of sympathy, there is a depth and realness to his character. He loves Star Wars, he tells good jokes, and he loves his dog, not unlike most of the young boys I know. Because he is more than his exterior, this book is able to transcend the ""after school special"" land that a book about a child with a birth defect often remains in. 
 Palacio's choice to tell the story through sections with different narrators is what propels it into award-winning territory. Hearing from Auggie's point of view is very important, but hearing from his sister Via, and some of the children at school adds another dimension to Wonder that works to its advantage. And it's rare that so many points of view are given and done well in a book for young readers. 
 One line that is repeated by the teenager characters in the book is ""the universe was not kind to Auggie Pullman."" And though this is true, and painfully real to readers, Wonder is not bogged down in Auggie's suffering. It's a book with a great deal of heart and joy, and a message that will resonate with both children and adults without seeming forced or contrived. The universe may not always be kind, but we are all able to be. I am thankful for the reminder.

 I loved the progression of the story through the multiple points of view tied together to move it forward and was drawn to Olivia's point of view. She has learned to fend for herself because of her brother's disfigurement with all of their parents' attention on him, but the reader also learns about her thoughts in the family but also at school and the differences, even hiding a part in the school's play, though no one doubts her love for Auggie. Readers also learn about Auggie's father's feelings-- he threw away a space helmet Auggie used to wear because he wanted to see his son's face. 
 So while I wouldn't say I unequivocally loved the book from the message to the writing to the story, I will say I appreciated the story and the language.

Yes, Auggie has facial deformities, and going to school (middle school) for the first ever, is a huge change. But like he says, he's just an ordinary kid too. 
 There are a ton of awesome lines in the book. The writing is realistic and honest, though I did have a hard time believing a 5th grader would call his mom and dad ""mommy"" and ""daddy"", but whatever. 
 Favorite lines: 
 Justin (Via's boyfriend) my head swirls on this, but then softer thoughts soothe, like a flatted third on a major chord. no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. 
 Auggie - Now that I look back, I don't know why I was so stressed about it all this time. Funny how sometimes you worry a lot about something and it turns out to be nothing. 
 Auggie - That's not exactly true: I do know what I'm really known for. But there's nothing I can do about that. A Star Wars duffel bag I could do something about.

 While the point-of-view shifts were fun, I felt like they were a little bit of a copout, especially since they dwindled toward the end of the book. August's perspective was clearly the main pov, and I wonder if we would have gained more if we weren't able to see into his sister's and peers' perspectives.

 I really wish there could be schools like these all over the world so kids could learn a thing or two about empathy, of how accepting differences makes world a little, even if a tiny bit more fortunate. 
 Overall i found this book really cute, which is - a total opposite of what i would have expected. I thought this was going to be a slightly depressive story, given by the synopsis. The depressive feeling kind of pulled me in, yet i was not disappointed, not even slightly. What i actually read was a story of how you can get through hardships if you have people around you who support you. I think it's a wonderful thing to have, meaning you really have to care about people who you are surrounded with. Sigh i should try to be a better person, too!! 
 Not to mention this made me think that why on Earth do I frown about my own looks, when right there is this little boy who has it way harder than myself, and yet he is able to laugh and get through this. Although i do know that he has loads of hardships to come, since it's only middle school, but for now, in that book's universe, he is who he is. August Pullman :) A cute little orc. 
 Overall, this book is for all ages, cause you learn a thing or two how should people be. 
 Spoilerish sidenotes, read this if you have read the story: 
 Sidenote1: I might want to try drawing him, at one point.With those eyes around his cheeks, with little longer hair and all that. 
 Sidenote2: Oh and August had the best parents ever. EVERY PARENT SHOULD BE LIKE THAT!! Seriously. 
 Sidenote3: The funniest part was surprisingly with Olivia's boyfriend. The way he defended Jack was hilarious!! Using that case to pretend to be a hitman. Just lol! 
 Sidenote4: The only thing that i wish could have been better if the author had used more synonyms, but i really liked how she used loads of idioms! 
 ENDING (SPOILER) My eyes got wet in the end because i was so happy for him.. especially that ''Everyone needs a little applaud once in their lives.'' And that happened to August, too. And when he went there on stage, i kept thinking maybe it's the last time he could be this happy, or will this last forever for him?.. mixed feelings made me just.. Gawww...

 I look forward to reading this book with my almost middle school son. It has moments that will appeal to kids used to reading humorous middle school titles such as ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" or ""Justin Case"", but it also reminds me of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"".

 Para ser sinceros, pense que el libro me iba a gustar mucho mas, que lo iba amar de principio a fin y que, por poner una comparacion algo burda, terminaria con la sensacion que me dejo TFIOS. Sin embargo, no fue del todo asi. No es que no sea un buen libro, o una buena historia, o que este aburrido o pesado, solo que me falto mas para que me ganara. Es un libro bueno, si, pero pudo ser mucho mejor. 
 La historia es muy sencilla de seguir. Tiene una descripcion muy ligera, por no decir que es casi nula; y con ello te enfocas en la linea argumental y puedes disfrutar el libro. No te pierdes ya que no necesita ""mucha"" interpretacion. Es decir, lo que te quieren contar es exactamente lo que estas leyendo. Nada de entrelineas. La escritura en primera persona, y la narracion perfilada a la edad de los personas fueron de las cosas que mas me gustaron. 
 El intento de contar la historia por diferentes puntos de vista me parecio algo ingenioso y que podia complementar/ enriquecer la historia, pero se quedo ahi, en un intento. Algunos de los puntos de vista los considere necesario y en algunos puntos repetitivos. Siento que al final con haber sido narrado por August o tener un narrador iba a poder explicar las cosas que intento hacer J.R. Palacios poniendo diferentes angulos. Ademas, aunque se que es cuestion de la edicion, la narracion del punto de vista de Justin esta toda en Minuscula y es un poco raro/incomodo. 
 Mis personajes favoritos fueron: August, Jack Will y Summer. Sin duda dejan a todos con una leccion de vida, ya que para ser ninos parecen entender a los demas en una forma que a veces los adultos no pueden. La historia merece ser leida, sin dudas. Aunque en algunos momentos me parecio muy predecible, muy linda, muy ""todo es perfecto"", ademas de un final poco cerrado. 
 En conclusion, La Leccion de August es un libro bonito recomendable tanto para las personas que aun no estan del todo en la lectura como para las que ya estan y quieren leer un libro ligero, enriquecedor y positivo.","Wed Apr 10 21:39:05 -0700 2013","Thu May 09 19:55:18 -0700 2013","Thu May 09 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Wed May 08 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

 He's just an ordinary boy who, unfortunately, is a bearer of some genetic disease. Not very heroic, but I think everyone would agree that the courage that he showed throughout the book was exceptional. I don't think I could have done that. 
 The scenes is the book were so heartfelt that I can actually picture myself in the situation of August. And I could really tell, even from my kindest imagination, that what he had been through is difficult, especially when placed upon the shoulders of a child. 
 This is a very inspirational book and a great reminder for everyone to appreciate each and every blessing that we have. We must understand that we are lucky compared to those people who suffer not only physical anomalies but also spiritual and emotional ones. 
 And by all means, let us try to be ""kinder than necessary"" to others. As they say, your deeds are your monuments.

Up until now. Auggie is about to start the fifth grade and his parents have decided that it would be good for him to go to school for the first time. Auggie has learned to live with the stares, the sideways glances, the mean comments, but he's especially scared of starting middle school where students can be especially mean to one another for reasons less than Auggie's facial deformities. And Auggie's suspicions are right except for two students, Summer and Jack, who befriend him through lonely lunches, ""the Plague"", and an especially rude parent who doesn't believe Auggie should be a student at his school. Auggie's family is wonderfully supportive and his sister, Via, begins attending a new school just as Auggie does so she can especially relate. His dad is funny, his mom supportive. Everyone wants to be a part of Auggie's family. The school year comes to a climax towards the end of the book when Auggie is bullied by students from another school and his classmates stand up for him. Auggie's awarding of a special award at the end brings the book to a wonderful conclusion. 
 This was one of the best books I've read for this age level. It is especially appropriate for discussions about bullying and would make a fabulous read-aloud, especially with the short one to two page chapters. This book is told through the eyes of not only Auggie but his sister and his friends which provides different perspectives of Auggie's stories. Again, this would make for great classroom discussion. This is, by far, my pick for the Newbery this year!","Tue May 22 10:37:25 -0700 2012","Fri Oct 30 07:04:05 -0700 2015","Fri Oct 19 13:32:53 -0700 2012","Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

 This was a beautiful, wonderful book. 
 RJ Palacio does a fantastic job of capturing the voice of a 5th grader and really getting the childish aspects as well as the mature aspects. She does a fantastic job of showing the complex social structures of 5th grade an high school. She also does a beautiful job writing many other voices in the story to create a truly fleshed out tale of one remarkable kid. It was also a relatively quick and easy read, which is always a good thing in my book. 
 I really loved the storyline, all of the characters were incredibly endearing (which usually makes for a good book for me) and it was really, really touching. I think this was beautifully, gracefully written and Palacio had so much respect for her character that showed in her writing.

I loved it almost, almost, completely. 
 The characters were wonderful: complicated, fragile, and believable. August had me from page one. I thought the multiple POVs added much to the story. Via's take on things brought me to tears -- the first of many I cried over this book. Palacio knows a lot about human nature, the good and the bad. 
 The ending, though, was so schmaltzy and Hollywood-ready; I can't describe my sense of dread as I read the last sixty or so pages, and the crushing disappointment I felt as everything wrapped up in the most predictable, precious way it possibly could have. 
 HOWEVER, this is still a book that I think has the potential to make the world better, or at least make people nicer and more aware of and more sympathetic to people's differences. I hope that kids enjoy it as much as adults seem to, because this one will make a difference. 
 Don't disappoint me, Newberry committee!

 The truth is, this book is a heart-feeding book. A very good vitamin to made us as kind and heart person. Spoiler alert, this book will squeeze your heart because there are many sincerity, love and attention.

This book will have you crying and laughing all in the same breath. You will come away from the book, desperate to become a better person. A truly life changing book. If you go to buy one book, buy a few copies of Wonder, because I can guarantee you will be urging other people to read it too. 
 I am old enough to remember watching Mask and The Elephant Man, which were both based on similar true stories, so I had an inkling as to what I was letting myself in for when I began reading this book. I knew that the book would emotionally rock my world and it did. I think I actually put off reading it for awhile as I just knew I would be upset by it. 
 Not that I am upset by the way the Auggie looks, no not at all. I was more upset by the way society reacted to Auggie. He was just a kid, who loved to do all the things other children do. He hurts and feels just like everyone else, so to suffer such torment really did upset me. I loved Auggie completely and if I was his mother, I would be just as protective. He is the sweetest child I have ever come across in literature. 
 I think one of the things that really stood out for me in this book was the way the dog, Daisy, loved Auggie and licked his face in the same way he would anyone else. Animals don't see the differences in people, so why do we as humans make such a big deal about it. Auggie really is a wonder, he is a medical wonder, as his condition is such a rarity. His heart is so big, it is impossible not to fall in love with him. 
 I loved all the secondary characters in the book, especially as we got to view Auggie and his life through their eyes too. All of the secondary characters were very strongly written yet each had their own quirkiness that made them very real. Via was one of my favourites. She loved her brother completely, but sometimes she just wanted to be seen for herself and not as being the sister of Auggie. I could understand that as it must have at times been very difficult for her. She was very strong and supportive and was desperate to see her brother stand up for who he was. She didn't want to see him being treated like a baby all his life. He needed to be able to face people and deal with the way they looked at him. 
 Throughout Auggie's school year, you see how everyone learns to love Auggie for who he is and not for what he looks like anymore. He finally has friends and they love him just as they would anyone else. Truly heartwarming to read. 
 I cannot praise this book enough. It truly is a wonderful read and I will nag you all to read it. Although make sure you have lots of tissues available as I can guarantee you will cry. A book you want to hug!

With incredible courage the journey begins and Auggie shares the good and the bad of 5th grade. The book is told from multiple perspectives, his, his sister, Via, his classmates at the school, and even some of Via's friends, which put me in mind of Because of Mr. Terupt by Rob Buyea, but more often some of the treatment that Auggie received reminded me of Melanie in Out of My Mind by Sharon Draper. I hope that teachers will consider reading this book aloud to students, because it certainly will open the door for discussions. 
 May 8 2013 - I just reread this book, having the opportunity to read it with a group of 4th graders.

 I was thinking of a conversation that Jamie Johns Whitehurst and I used to have about YA and even Juv materials. It seems like in the majority of these materials the reoccurring theme is that one or both parents are missing, dead or neglegent in some way. No one writes the story about the kid who has a great relationship with his family. Now there is one! This is it! Part of what makes this book so special is that the main character's development is tied directly to the relationships he build--the most important being those of his family and close friends. No one is dead, lost,or on drugs. It's just the story of a kid overcoming some crappy odds.

Palacio writes with the empathy and grace only a mother can have in such vast reserves, and the novel serves as a lighthearted but powerful reminder to simply choose kindness. It falls apart a little at the seams, however; there are too many narrative perspectives that are not distinguishable enough from one another, with a couple undoubtedly irrelevant sections (definitely Justin's and maybe even Jack's), although it was a joy to read from the perspective of Via and Summer and, surprisingly, especially the ""after"" section from Julian. The end of the story is neatly packaged and tied in a perfect bow, yet within that package not everything seems to be in order - for example, the sister who figures so heavily into the story in the first two-thirds has all but disappeared at the end. In more than a few places throughout the book, the dialogue seems a little off, but we can always count on Auggie to give us the most honest and bittersweet story.

 Unlike the Great Gatsby, a ""classic,"" you don't read Wonder for the symbolism and plethora of literary tools (I actually don't really understand why we force it upon high school students). Instead, you read Wonder because it's about kindness and appreciation - two things from which this all humans would benefit. 
 Wonder centers around August Pullman, a fifth grader with a facial deformity that kept him from going to school. The story is told from the point of view of several young people - mainly fifth graders, but a couple of high school students as well. It's not all heavy. There's some laughter in there, and there's determination and resilience. 
 There's also a clarity that comes with children and their perception. This is actually my favorite part of the book. Kids see and understand more than we adults think they do, and I like how Palacio captures this in her story. 
 So, go get this one and read it. If you have kids, read it with them, and talk about the book. There's great lessons to be learned - especially if you wonder what you would have done had you been August's parents, and what you would do, had you been August or his sister, Via. But most of all, remember this book. Remember it when you're having a tough time. Remember it when you meet someone different.","Mon Sep 09 11:16:01 -0700 2013","Tue Oct 08 21:07:41 -0700 2013","Tue Oct 08 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,""

 What am I to do in trying to write a review for a book like Wonder? How rarely do authors in their first published novel come through to the extent R.J. Palacio has in this book, blasting open the walls of the learning curve to travel places beyond what ninety-nine percent of writers will ever comprehend, let alone actually reach? Wonder is one of the most rawly emotional books I've read in years, a parade of short bits of story, character development and anecdotal demonstration of feelings and thoughts racing all toward the singular point that is the end of the narrative, when so many different pieces of volcanically emotive drama fit together in what was being created the whole time, though we couldn't always see it: a completed portrait of Auggie Pullman, a boy heading through life with genetic burdens no one person should ever have to carry. A year in fifth grade with a facial deformity that will be the first thing everyone he meets notices about him, so serious a malformation of features that even those used to seeing people with physical abnormalities instinctively recoil at the sight? That's a long year to endure no matter the other circumstances, even when the school administration has taken the proactive approach of setting up a small network of acquaintances for the boy with a few preselected students a couple of weeks before the first day of school. Is it really possible that out of the furnace of middle school's first year, Auggie will emerge not burned to a crisp by the open hostility of those students who will never try to understand that he's a normal kid deep down, but rather refined by the furnace's intense heat, granted absolution by the few persistently kind kids there are for a facial structure he cannot change and never asked for in the first place? This is Wonder. This is the story of Auggie Pullman, a story and boy I had come to love deeply by page last, because it would have been impossible for me not to love them. What could have been just another excellent story among so many others became, because of the extra labor of love put forth by R.J. Palacio to the creation of a story as close to perfect as possible, a life-changing event that has affected me as powerfully as pretty much any other book I've ever read. There was never any real doubt over my awarding it five stars. 
 ""Here's what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way."" 
 --Auggie Pullman, Wonder, P. 3 
 Born with a series of chromosomal maladies that clicked all wrong in exactly the wrong places, giving him a face distorted and caved in with features scattered where they don't quite belong, Auggie has been protected his entire life by his parents and older sister, Via. Regular school has never been seriously considered an option; to have put Auggie into the traditional elementary-school learning environment with other young children who had never seen anything like his face would have been an invitation to disaster. So Auggie has been homeschooled up through fourth grade, and exposure to other kids has remained limited and always a product of careful engineering. While this process seems to have worked decently well, landing Auggie a handful of kids over the years whom he could call real friends, he doesn't see any of them frequently. In the year he'll be entering fifth grade, though, Auggie's social paradigm takes a crazy turn when his parents tenuously suggest he consider attending a regular school for the first time. Unbeknownst to him, he has been accepted into one of the best private middle schools in the area, a haven for academic success and challenging school curriculum that will test Auggie's adept mind more comprehensively than his mother has been able to at home. It's Auggie's choice whether or not he wants to go, but even as he struggles with the offer, treading water on the rising sea of his emotions at the idea of shaking things up after years of consistency in matters of education, Auggie knows this is an opportunity that doesn't come along every day; never, for most students. Introduction to the mainline stream of formal education isn't going to be easy for Auggie, even at the start of middle school when all the students will be adjusting to a new school and new peers, but he can't dismiss its ultimate value. 
 And from that first day of tentative investigation into the idea, when Principal Tushman has Auggie meet three students he praises for their kind character and welcoming personalities--Julian, Charlotte and Jack Will--it's off to the races, a never-slowing run down a Black Diamond ski slope that feels as if it could go careening totally out of control at any moment, at devastating cost of life and limb. Auggie's acclimation to his new school is torrentially paced, the smallest yet most crucial nuances of communication and lack thereof to give us a clue as to what's really going on whizzing by unnoticed if we're not observant. Yet just as much as it feels like a wild downhill ski run, Auggie's emotional existence also feels like a walk: one foot in front of the other, upon the edge of a giant sharpened knife, where one slight misstep could send him plunging to a fate better not discussed. This is middle school for Auggie; at times, that is. There are also moments when kids in the student body cast aside their revulsion at Auggie's strange outward appearance, some temporarily and others for keeps, and approach the newest new boy of them all with only slight trepidation, just a modicum of horror at what they never perceived a human face could be. It is these kids, shirking the curtain of isolation that has surrounded Auggie since his first day of attendance, who are able to lead him off the knife's edge on occasion, giving him respite for a while from the intensity of the knife-walk that his life at school usually is. 
 One can never guess the twists and turns of an entire year as it lays unmapped, sprawled in the ghostly mists of the future where even our most honorable intentions in attempting to divine its secrets cannot penetrate the thick fog. With immaculate skill light-years beyond her modest experience, R.J. Palacio spins with all the skill of nature's master architect, the spider, the tale of one year alongside Auggie Pullman, doing Charlotte A. Cavatica proud with every story strand both silky and not-so-silky she threads to join with and strengthen the larger web structure of the narrative. It's only fitting that one of the most important characters Auggie is introduced to at school is named Charlotte. And just as the strength of the spider's web belies its graceful, wispy appearance, so R.J. Palacio's story of personal acceptance, kindness in the face of blatant rejection, the complexities and realization of genuine friendship and the rewards of living a full life when confronted again and again by sadness and trauma in its many forms is shored up with internal fabric stronger than steel. It's the same stuff Auggie is made of on the inside, and he's not the only one in the story about whom I could say that. Is it any surprise, all considered, that perhaps the best word to describe this book is stamped right on the cover: Wonder? 
 The story glitters with jewels spread throughout, and it doesn't take much digging to find caches of the valuable stuff. When Auggie is informed that the first three kids he's going to meet at his new school are right on the other side of Principal Tushman's office door, waiting to be introduced, he briefly reflects on why it's different meeting kids in middle school than younger children. ""What's cool about really little kids is that they don't say stuff to try to hurt your feelings, even though sometimes they do say stuff that hurts your feelings. But they don't actually know what they're saying. Big kids, though: they know what they're saying."" Even though he's never been part of a class of other kids, Auggie has already drawn this observation about how things work, and it's an astute one. One really is, in general, much safer with younger kids, who have no agenda to want to say mean things to gain the approval of unkind peers. Readers should also keep their eyes out for ""Mr. Browne's Precepts"" in the story, included when their meaning intersects with Auggie's narrative. One of my favorites is ""When given the choice between being right and being kind, choose kind"". I also like Charlotte's Postcard Precept she sends in to Mr. Browne to complete the summer assignment: ""It's not enough to be friendly. You have to be a friend."" The depths of that statement are quite profound. I should pin those words up somewhere I will see them everyday and be reminded that real friendship is so much more than the sum of its parts. 
 Auggie's take on Halloween is a great one, his feelings reflecting more than just the wishes of a boy who knows this is the one day of the year when his facial eccentricities can be kept hidden behind facades of latex and plastic. ""I wish every day could be Halloween. We could all wear masks all the time. Then we could walk around and get to know each other before we got to see what we looked like under the masks."" Of course, this tends to happen anyway, in a much subtler sense than Auggie is suggesting, but not even something as traumatic as the Halloween Incident can ruin Auggie's use for Halloween as a day when he can take a vacation from being himself. An opportunity like that is important to have once in a while. Even as Auggie deals with the ups and downs of a year in which so much has changed, and is continuing to change, for him, not every transformation is scary or unwelcome, no matter how bad he may have expected it to be. After receiving a bit of medical assistance that increases his ability to enjoy life in one particular way, Auggie is relieved it doesn't turn out to be the ordeal for which he'd been steeling himself. ""Funny how sometimes you worry a lot about something and it turns out to be nothing"", he thinks. That does seem to be a near universal experience, just as it is that one's own most terrifying troubles often go unnoticed by most of the world. As Auggie observes after a sudden crisis he gets through with the help of some friends, ""It's so weird how that can be, how you could have a night that's the worst in your life, but to everybody else it's just an ordinary night."" Auggie is growing increasingly capable of handling his own problems when they do crop up, apart from the abundant help his parents have been there to provide for most of his life. And even though Auggie will always love his parents specially, differently than other kids feel about their parents, knowing how to troubleshoot independently from them is an accomplishment that will serve him through all the many days to come after fifth grade. Whether or not it ever gets easier, Auggie knows he has what it takes to make it. 
 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 --Auggie, P. 231 
 My thoughts on this book would not be complete without a mention of just how much I loved Jack Will. It's not because he's a perfect kid, a paragon of faultless kindness in a sea that often hides nasty creatures and sharp, dangerous bits of debris; no, we learn for sure in Wonder how imperfect Jack Will can be, like any other human. I think I love Jack so because of his imperfection; because he was able to create such happiness in us at his initial attitude, it made the shock of the Halloween Incident feel all the more treacherous, sparking feelings of real anger and bitterness, a cathartic desire to side with Auggie and press the eject button on so-called friends, because who needs to hear their side of the story? But it's exactly that shift from glowing pride to deep resentment that makes it all the more an emotional experience when the story does come full circle, and the little pieces of unseen truth we felt it unnecessary to see back in the moment of first hurt come to mean a whole lot more than we could have guessed. That is why I love Jack Will, why his presence in the story is so stingingly poignant, why I never wanted the book to end. While his story, such an integral part of Auggie's, was still going, I, too, was part of it, and friends the likes of Jack Will are much fewer and farther apart than I wish they were. I actually find myself missing Jack Will, and I hope I never stop. What does that say about R.J. Palacio's abilities as a writer? 
 Books like Wonder are maybe a one in a hundred proposition, at best. That is, if I read a hundred books I have legitimate hopes will blow my mind as Wonder did, perhaps one of those hundred will actually live up to that potential. I'd have to say Wonder is, in my eyes, one of the bigger surprises of its era among deserving books not to have received official commendation from the Newbery Committee. I could easily see it having won the Medal, a book as worthy of the decoration as almost any other that came before it. If R.J. Palacio never wrote another book, she would be the one-hit wonder whose single contribution to literature was equal to a lifetime of compelling fiction from most authors, a tribute to and challenge of the stunning beauty of the best humanity has to offer, played out by those most likely to take up the challenge and carry it farthest: kids, like Auggie and Jack Will and Julian and Christopher. It is on their shoulders that Wonder takes its voyage, and therefore could only ever have gone as far as they were willing to bring it. To me, that's the most beautiful part of all.","Fri Feb 15 18:13:23 -0800 2013","Fri Jul 07 09:52:00 -0700 2017","Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 -0800 2013",12,3,""

It isn't because he never wanted to, it was because he never could. After being born with an almost unknown birth defect, he has had over 25 surgeries in his short 10 years of life. Now, after a time of surgery-free life, Auggie's parents have decided that it is time for Auggie to go to school. As a 5th grader. Which is the first year of middle school. As Auggie's dad says, it is like leading a lamb to slaughter and the ride that Auggie goes on is a roller coaster of emotions. 
 What I think: There are certain books that while you are reading, you wish that you could share it with every person, adult and child, that you know. This is one of those books. It is almost too hard to explain because of how wonderful it is. It is a book that will make you want to be kinder to every person that you meet. It is already a lesson that I try to teach my students and a book like this will assist me in showing them how words and actions can affect another person. 
 Although August is amazing and you cannot feel for and love his character, there are 2 other characters that made this book for me. First, Summer. She shows that there are 10 year olds that are still loving and thoughtful. The other is Mr. Browne. I love his precepts and how he teaches his class. What a way to make students reflect about their lives and to think deeply. 
 ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go... My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" (p. 1)

But different sections are narrated by different characters, so the tone is really important to the story line and serves to distinguish the characters from one another and is a very effective way of developing their personalities. After I got over the ""Auggie"" tone, which was choppy and very matter of fact, similar to his personality, I was drawn into the story itself. 
 The specifics of Auggie's disease and the actual physical deformities it causes are never described in detail in the text, which bothered the scientist in me at first. But the book isn't about that; it's about friendships and the ability of people to look beyond the physical. To do this, the author writes this story from several perspectives, which really highlights how different people struggle with this. 
 We read from all of August's peers and his sister, but never from his parents or the few teachers that are central characters in this story. Given that it is a middle grade book, this makes sense, but I would have liked to have heard more from the adults. 
 August is a special child and he is lucky to have found such a great group of friends. I question how realistic this story really is though. I'm a tad bit cynical, but realistically there would be fewer people who are able to look beyond the physical. Sad, but true.","Mon Jan 28 07:59:09 -0800 2013","Fri Jan 03 05:39:48 -0800 2014","Thu Feb 28 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,2,"False"

 Wonder is a beautifully crafted book that peels back the harsh middle school environment one perspective at a time to show the insecurities and humanity of each child. There are no huge surprises here with the plot, but the candor of the rotating narration keeps it out of afterschool special territory. My only real issue with the book is that the narrating characters had similar voices, which made it confusing at times to keep it all straight. However, the message of the value of kindness was well set up and made for a great ending.","Thu Apr 19 21:21:37 -0700 2012","Fri Apr 05 15:16:25 -0700 2013","Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

 I really liked this book because it shows the different perspectives of the characters about the same thing. It was a super fast read that I enjoyed a lot and I guess the only critique I have is the ending. 
 SPOILER-y critique ahead 
 People don't ever change that fast. Kids are cruel. Kids don't find their moral as they could find their lost mp3 in their room. Nope. That doesn't happen. I've been bullied for several years and let me just say that things do not change from one day to another. People don't start being nice just for the sake of being good guys. Huh, huh, no. In real life, Auggie would have had to deal with the same a**holes. He wouldn't become popular, nor loved by everybody. I think that ending, even if it's cute and such, made the book unrealistic.

 It is a beautiful story told from shifting perspectives about a fifth grade boy with severe facial abnormalities. I cried a lot reading it (be warned, don't read it in public, I was crying at my daughter's cello lesson in the corner over the book) but not all sad tears - it's a very honest and tender and non-sanctimonious examination of the highs and lows of what human beings are capable of in their interactions with each other. 
 A quote I loved - from Mr. Tushman's commencement speech at the end - ""'Always try to be a little kinder than necessary.' (JM Barrie) ... Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed. Why I love that line, that concept, is that it reminds me that we carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness. ... If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God.""","Sat Oct 20 23:19:15 -0700 2012","Sat Oct 20 23:32:20 -0700 2012","","",1,0,"False"

Primero porque sentia que era como que otro libro que no aportaba nada, y porque tenia como la impresion que el final traeria una especie de ""milagro"" Dios mio, no puedo estar mas arrepentido. 
 Wonder o La leccion de August como lo conozcan sigue a Auggie Pullman, un chico que posee deformidad facial, y que ha sido intervenido varias veces para ayudarlo a tener un rostro casi humano y por supuesto para solucionar algunos problemas de salud. Auggie nunca ha asistido a la escuela con otros ninos, y ahora su madre cree que es el momento de hacerlo convenciendo asi a su padre y finalmente convenciendo al mismo Auggie. Las preocupaciones son claras, la crueldad que puede llegar a existir en cierto grupos de ninos y que podrian terminar afectando a este chico. La travesia aca es lograr que el resto de su clase, el resto de la escuela, el resto del mundo puedan llegar ver mas alla de lo que el fisico de este chico representa y puedan ver su increible personalidad, su hermosa alma y un gigantezco corazon que posee. 
 La trama transcurre justo como lo esperaba, no dire que es como una sorpresa porque no se permiten sorpresas aqui, sabemos que pasara en cierta manera y sabemos como queremos que se desarrolle e incluso como queremos que termine. Y me encanta que todas las personas que intervienen de manera significativa en la vida de Auggie tengan la oportunidad de relatar como ven su mundo y como observan al chico. Sin embargo, he odiado la manera en la que esta constituido como en pequenos capitulos, siempre me provoca una especie de confusion como si me he saltado algunas hojas. Me lo he leido super rapido, porque ha sido sencillo. Y de no ser por tener otras responsabilidad probablemente lo hubiese acabado el mismo dia. 
 Auggie es un chico maravilloso, a pesar de como es, y de como muchas personas lo ven, El ha sabido llevarlo de una manera increible, y no se ha negado ni por un segundo a que todo mejorara con el tiempo y esta decidido a dejar que las cosas mejoren. Me encanta como personaje, creo que es divertidisimo, es especial pero no por su apariencia, es especial por la manera en la que conectas con su alma. Y es el personaje adecuado del cual aprender un millon de cosas. Tambien me encantan sus amigos Jacky Summer, aunque parezca absurdo estos chicos demuestran valentia en ir contra todos porque ven lo especial de este chico. 
 De verdad me he equivocado con este libro, me ha encantado y creo que deberia ser compartido millones de veces y llevarlo hasta las futuras generaciones. Hay mucha crueldad en el mundo y libros como estos podrian ayudarnos a erradicar parte de ella.

 Auggie has severe facial deformities. He has gone through countless surgeries to fix how he looks & while it is better, he will never look normal. His mom decides he should stop being homeschooled & start school at a private school. At first he is against it, but he ends up going anyway. It is tough at first because he has no friends & is kind of a freak show. But slowly, he starts to make friends. The story switches perspectives so we can see how torn his sister is over sometimes feeling like she doesn't want people to know about him & how other people he interacts have their own issues with parents divorcing etc. Towards the end of the school year his class goes on a 2 day trip where they hike around the woods. He has a great time until some kids from another school make him feel like a total freak and try to push him around. Then some kids from his school rally around him & get in a fight helping defend him. After that, he really is treated like one of the gang. He graduates with friends & is looking forward to the following school year. Good book.","Wed Apr 17 12:45:06 -0700 2013","Wed Apr 17 12:45:34 -0700 2013","Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",0,0,""

Parents could most definitely share in the reading experience to help to instill & discuss the message found throughout the book - showing kindness towards other.","Mon Jul 08 06:38:28 -0700 2013","Sat Nov 09 04:13:07 -0800 2013","Sat Nov 09 04:13:07 -0800 2013","Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,0,""

Grades 3-6 is probably the most appropriate audience. That said, for children in that age range, it is an excellent book, and would be a great first novel to read as a class to introduce concepts such as point of view and theme. The story reminded me of Freak the Mighty, which I taught as a first year teacher, in tone and character; however, this novel is not as plot heavy, and for that reason, it may bore some reluctant readers. The characters were likable and the morals portrayed in Palacio's book are truly good, solid lessons to drive home to kids.

Auggie is used to being stared at and shunned for his unusual appearance, but he has always been somewhat sheltered and protected in the safety of his family and homeschooled by his mother. Now as a 5th grader, Auggie is about to begin attending a regular school for the very first time. As might be expected, Auggie's physical appearance makes his first year at Beecher Prep extremely challenging but ultimately rewarding. 
 This is a very moving book. Kids can be cruel as we all know, but this book shows that kids can also be kind. There is cruelty but also a lot of goodness in this story. I especially liked Auggie's parents. It seems in books written for this age group, parents are often represented as absent or negligent or self-absorbed or clueless. It was refreshing to read about solid parents who were right there and really trying to do the right thing for their kids in the midst of difficult circumstances. 
 I really liked this book...but you might want to keep some tissues handy while reading.","Fri Oct 12 11:13:47 -0700 2012","Tue Jun 24 15:46:04 -0700 2014","","",0,0,""

 A first-person account of a young boy with an uncommon face, the narrative pops from one young head to another in a way that should be distracting, if not downright chaotic. Instead, by giving you the chance to step outside of August's perspective and see all the hidden ways in which his condition affects family and friends, this brilliant bit of rule-breaking broadens your appreciation of a tale that's bound to remind you why kindness is -- and forever will be -- king. Along with the true-to-tween ramblespeech that sometimes meanders across the page, there is an optimism and innocence to each chapter that nicely balances the emotional heaviness of the main character's first attempts at joining the ""normal"" world of middle school, where bullies hide behind friendships, flashlights, and parents alike. 
 In short, it is uplifting, it is entertaining, and it wields each blemish like a lesson the rest of us have yet to learn. Just like August.","Sun May 18 20:44:33 -0700 2014","Mon May 19 21:16:02 -0700 2014","Mon May 19 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sun May 18 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

The story is simple and at the first instant it looks like hundreds of others wherein the protagonist has some disability and then he overcomes that becoming a hero. I would not call August a disable, yet he is no ordinary child. Imagine yourself screaming away people! Imagine people giving you that pity look! Imagine children of your class having this view that one touch of yours will make them like you! Imagine born with that face! 
 In a world where how you look holds paramount importance, August does not only have an ugly face, he has a deformed face. But hold on, he is not someone who sits back and cribs about it. Yes, occasionally he has breakdowns; he has those moments where he wonders what has he been wrong to get this treatment but this small kid of 13 knows how to laugh at himself. And this is what touches you the most. Protected by a loving family, August has always been home schooled until his parents decide to send him to school. A new experience altogether, here August finds friends who initially talked to him out of pity but soon realized that inside the ugly face lies a normal teenager, one who is not superficial, one whom you can trust, one who is brilliant in academics inspite of being homeschooled . 
 What has left me awestruck is the maturity of this child. While reading the book, I was wondering had I been in his position, would I have had the courage to go out? I think not! 
 This book made me sad and happy at the same time. Sad, because of our narrow perception of beauty: How do we judge people and make choices in our life has so much to do with how we look and how other look according to us! Come on, be true to yourselves: how often do we give those glances to people who do not look like us, people who are born different 
 Happy, because despite all our judgement of people based on how they look, there is enough kindness in the world. I was happy to read about transformation of people from befriending him out of pity to being true friends. And the book made me smile when August got his well-deserved 'standing ovation' in the end. 
 I think it should be made must read for every child to instill in them seeds of kindness and to make them sensitize towards others. And not only children, this book is for every person because there is an August Pullman in everyone. And because everybody secretly wishes that 'there should be a rule that everyone in this world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lifetime'.","Thu Apr 25 01:12:20 -0700 2013","Thu Jul 25 11:14:23 -0700 2013","Sat Apr 27 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Thu Apr 25 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

 Teaching important lessons throughout a novel without preaching or patronising is a very difficult line to walk, in my experience not many authors can do it, but R J Palacio did just that and then some. People of all ages should read this book. Going into this I thought ""What could I possibly learn from a book classed as middle grade?""

I LOVED this book. It's the story of a boy born with a severe and very rare birth defect that has mostly affected his face and hearing. It's the story of growing up with this challenge told not just from the boy (August Pullman)'s perspective, but also told from his those that come into his life as he turns ten and attends school for the first time entering the fifth grade. 
 I straight up cried three times while reading this book, and teared up another three - four, so there are definitely heartbreaking moments in this story. Emotions expressed through the way that only a fifth grader can, that brought me back to my own experiences growing up and also made me brace myself for Arlo's experiences to come. This is one of those books that as a parent makes you so thankful for your healthy children, and also makes you aware of how important it is to have those children be kind, empathetic people. 
 As August enters school for the first time he has many challenges with making friends, especially at first, as there is a class jerk (of course), but there are also those kids that are simply good people. You cheer for August as things become easier for him and he makes friends, and your heart breaks for him when the pitfalls come, and of course they do. For whatever reason I was very much able to take this fictional child right into my heart and wanted to protect him and help him as he goes through this year. As he experiences the same things that we all did: a bully, those kids that you thought were your friends talking behind your back, isolation, and acceptance. 
 I don't want to give anything away, as I usually try not to do with my reviews, so I will just say that this is a book that I think everyone should add to their reading list. It made me think of an article about how those who read are able to be more empathetic and understanding because we experience these things that we read in a way that you can't simply by watching it on television, and this is something that you will be glad you experienced.","Wed Feb 15 08:31:49 -0800 2012","Mon Feb 25 08:00:33 -0800 2013","Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",0,0,""

There were a lot of references here to to modern day middle school culture such as Diary of a Wimpy Kid and newer Star Wars movies. This really brought the book down for me. Also, the fart topic in the first chapter and the repeated jokes about Mr Tushmans name got old FAST. I almost discontinued reading the book due to those. Beyond that, the book is great. I love how the story is told from the viewpoints of different characters, how not only Auggie is affected by his facial deformity but his friends and sister etc. I recommend this book as long as you can look past the immaturity of the first chapter and the modern references.","Tue Jan 31 19:02:36 -0800 2017","Wed Sep 20 12:42:22 -0700 2017","","",1,1,""

This book runs you through a gamut of emotions as you watch August go from being a protected home-schooled kid to experiencing the cruel realities of being a new kid in school. According to a twenty-year veteran middle school teacher I know who also read the book, Wonder is a very accurate portrayal of what goes on in a typical middle school. Despite its 320 pages it was a really quick read. While I was reading the book I kept thinking of a quote from one of my favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut: ""Hello babies. Welcome to Earth.

This year all that is about to change as Auggie will go to a real school for the first time and begin fifth grade at Beecher Prep. Wonder details Auggie's first year attending school with it's ups and downs. Palacio masterfully conveys themes of family, friendship, and bullying in her debut middle grade novel. Wonder is divided into eight parts told through a different character's perspective. The first and last parts are told through Auggie's perspective which brings all of the parts together. Palacio is not one to waste words and thus the pacing of Wonder is very tight and moves along. 
 Yet, what truly drives Wonder are the characters. Auggie is a sweet, earnest kid who loves Star Wars. He handles reactions to his deformity very well, he is used to people reacting badly to his face. Yet, we see his vulnerable side too. He is very realistically drawn. Via, August's older sister, is another exceptional character we meet in Wonder. We see her struggle between being Auggie's protector, the girl who everyone knows as August's sister, the easy child and between forming an identity for herself at her new high school. It's quite a touching side story and speaks to the complexity of family interactions. Palacio shows that kindness is necessary and something we should endeavor to treat others. I think in our fast paced world treating others with dignity is something to strive towards and not forget, and Wonder beautifully reinforces this idea.","Thu May 30 17:56:57 -0700 2013","Thu Jun 27 19:50:42 -0700 2013","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",0,0,""

 Sempurna karena lahir dengan perangkat lengkap. Langit-langit mulut menyatu, punya rahang, gigi geligi yang lengkap, punya tulang pipi, kelopak mata, hidung, bibir, alis, daun telinga. 
 Si Auggie ini nggak punya kelopak mata, nggak punya bibir, nggak punya rahang, nggak punya daun telinga. Gue sendiri agak susah membayangkannya. Ada pembaca Goodreads menyarankan untuk googling tentang sindrom Treacher-Collins syndrome...tapi gue nggak tega.

 Who deserves that? R.J. Palacio. This book was completely life-changing for me.

I smiled, nodded, took my bag moved right along. Now I know why. 
 I think this book gives us a beautiful opportunity and platform to discuss how we treat those that are different from us, physically and mentally. I could definitely see myself reading this to my kids when they are a bit older. It does provide a platform to teach us how judgement can be painful. The importance of empathy and compassion. 
 I thought Palacio did a wonderful job writing from the view point of these kids. My heart ached for them. I cheered for them. I wanted to hug them. In fact, after reading this, I wanted to hug everyone that I am close to and love dearly. 
 So many people talk about how sad the book is. Honestly, I only cried once, and it was when the DOG died. So I didn't really find the book SAD, but it did tug at my heart strings. 
 I did have one problem with this book, and I am definitely running the risk of sounding cold and heartless. But I think I am just thinking realistically. I feel like the book ended a bit TOO positively. The mean boy changed schools, August suddenly was friends with everyone, and he was given an award. It was beautiful...but was it true to the real world? In todays world, the mean kid won't always just change schools, or change his mind about you. The whole world has yet to learn to overlook things like physical deformities. I hope all those like August WILL have the courage to take on the world.

The differences are, R. J. Palacio - La leccion de August really tells the story, not a few sentences put together and most of the titles are a phrase. 
 It's important for the readers to know that August (main character) won't tell us what he looks like (especially the face) because he think he has an extraordinary face. So Palacio keeps us guessing as we read it, though she drops hints here and there and finally, she reveals them all. 
 Palacio plays every character very well. 
 She's consistent about the character's personality, down to the little details like responses and behavior tendencies. 
 As I read this book pages after pages, it occurs to me that the story was written beautifully raw it gives me a warmhearted feeling. I also stepped into the shoes of the less aggressive bullying victim and feel how uncomfortable it actually feels like. 
 Even though there's some repetition of the story, but we get to see it from another point of view. 
 About the plot: you never really know what's coming. 
 My favorite character: August. He can turn mean things people do to him into jokes that make me smile or laugh. His sarcasm is the best. 
 ""Sometimes people surprise us"" just like Palacio did when she tells me this story and reading this book is a wonderful journey. 
 I said once that even though kids are young, doesn't mean we can't learn from them and honestly, I learn many things from August. 
 I hope one day they turn this incredible story into a movie. 
 One more thing. I love this book, like love Augiee.

 secondly, the use of multiple point of view characters i found gave me a greater experience and helped me see Palacio's story in several different ways, i was a fan of this method of storytelling in Eleanor and Park, The red pyramid and A song of ice and fire (even though that's on a much grander scale)

 There are a few different POV's besides August's and I thought they melded nicely together to bring August's past and future together. Like I think all middle schoolers can attest, those particular grades are hard-even if you don't have a facial deformity. Kids are cruel, but August has a big, kind heart, and I love how authentic and genuine he is.

He has been home-schooled. Now it is time to start Middle School. Should he be mainstreamed? His parents disagree. 
 He becomes expert in knowing the exact milli-second a person notices him in the room, even when the person attempts to cover up the shock at seeing such a face. We get several clues in mid-point of the book as to what he looks like. 
 Auggie's favorite holiday is Halloween, because then he can wear a mask and no one knows who he is. But something happens on this Halloween Day .... 
 At first, I thought the whole book would be the P.O.V. (point of view) of this ten-year-old. I was pleased to come to Part Two, and find out the author switched to his older sister's voice. Via is starting high school and has problems of her own, including squabbling with her mom. Palacio did a great job writing differently for these two siblings. The other Parts include additional characters in the book. In sum, this is one of the most excellent books that give different P.O.V.'s in assorted styles of writing. 
 Natalie Merchant's song Wonder has this chorus: 
 They say I must be one of the wonders 
 Of god's own creation 
 And as far as they can see they can offer 
 No explanation 
 The author RJ Palacio stated in an interview about seeing a girl with facial deformities and being ashamed of her own reaction. She was afraid her younger son would say something rude so she rushed out of the ice-cream shop. This scene is in her book.

 Wonder is geared toward middle schoolers, but will appeal to YAs and adults too. It should be nominated for and even win the Newbery Award.","Sun Feb 26 13:39:22 -0800 2012","Sun Feb 26 13:54:15 -0800 2012","Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",1,0,""

He's smart enough, but he's anxious. This will be the first time he's had to deal with the push and pull of the middle school society. And he's right to worry. Due to an extremely rare genetic disorder, Auggie has severe facial deformities. He knows people will make fun of him, and that it won't be easy. 
 Auggie tells the reader that whatever s/he imagines that his face looks like, it is worse. He has no ears--no outer ears, so none that show. His eyes are too far down, in the vertical middle of his face. Everything about his face is misshapen, and though he's had nearly 30 surgeries, his face is still a shock to those who see him for the first time. 
 For a kid with so much going against him, Auggie is pretty centered. He has parents and a sister who really love him. And the principal at his new school has selected good students, 'good kids,' to show him around before the school year starts, to be nice to him. 
 That some of these students put on a face of kindness in front of the adults at school and then bully him behind his back shouldn't be a surprise. That one of them can get almost the entire school to turn against Auggie isn't a surprise either. What is a surprise is how the author catches the nuisance of this bullying--from kids who are truly mean to those who just don't know what to do and are having a crisis of conscience. 
 In fact, Palacio catches pretty much everything about middle school that illuminates what a difficult time of transition into adolescence it can be. 
 One of the things I really liked about Wonder is that it isn't peopled by saints/heroes and demons/villains. Auggie's older sister is tired of being thought of as the girl with the deformed brother (who takes up most of her parents' energy through no fault of his own). Still, she is fiercely devoted to Auggie. And even good people really are taken aback at Auggie's appearance. But while the novel accepts that this is normal, it also reminds us that after a week or two, people get used to the unusual features of Auggie's face and then forget about them. He just becomes Auggie, a kid, a schoolmate. 
 I'm always a sucker for good writing, and Wonder has got it. Palacio captures the kids--their conversations and interactions--realistically. 
 While Wonder is a children's book, with a target audience that is Auggie's age, give or take a few years, it's a quick read that even adults will enjoy. I highly recommend it to all. 
 High school housekeeping: Another thing that I love about this book is that, since anyone of any age can enjoy it, it's a great read for high school students working on their reading skills. This isn't true of most middle school books--they just don't interest high schoolers. And because teens like edgier stuff, books written for high school students who are reading below grade level usually deal with issues of teen pregnancy, drugs, gangs, etc. There's nothing wrong with that, and there are many of those books I recommend. But Wonder is another option--an opportunity to become immersed in beautiful writing, in Auggie's emotional responses to his classmates as well as the feelings of everyone who comes in contact with him. It's an opportunity to see how perceptions can and do change, how everything in the world isn't black and white. And that's great for anyone, struggling reader or not.","Fri Nov 22 11:54:22 -0800 2013","Fri Nov 22 12:11:47 -0800 2013","Fri Nov 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"False"

I will delay writing a review until the discussion. One thing I will say is that reading this book was a WONDERful experience! 
 UPDATE: 
 I want to mention first that rating this book was the hardest decision ever. I am still doubting my rating and I changed it twice already. It's an absolutely perfect book, I have no issues with it whatsoever but It was not THE BOOK so I couldn't give it 5 stars. 
 One thing that Nicholas Sparks said in a review of this book is ""The pages almost turn themselves"". I find that very accurate! 
 Alright My Review: I'll just copy everything I wrote in the notes I made after filtering 'em. here we go:- 
 (1)I love how in the book they describe Auggie's ability to read body language & to know or feel people's reactions even without directly meeting their eyes. I think people with special needs or those who suffer severe visible deformities feel that way too, and no matter how how 'normal' people try to pretend everything is or try to look like they didn't notice, they always know.. no matter how nice you try to be, it's still there, and I think it hurts in an indirect way, in a way no one can control.. i think it's one of the most difficult things to live with. 
 I support August's mother decision in admitting him to a school, because sooner or later, he's gonna have to face the world, so it's better for him to earn to adapt to everything around him now instead of hiding behind his mother. 
 (2) VIA'S POINT OF VIEW. Well done! 
 We needed to hear from her. Usually characters like her are neglected by both the family and the author, so thank you Palacio for giving Via a voice. 
 (3) I was in the car on my way to Dubai when I read the part about Daisy's Death and the note I wrote says: "" Sad.. Sad.. Sad 
 I would've allowed myself to cry if I weren't in the car with 7 people around me. The story might be fiction but my tears aren't :'( 
 P.S: I did tear up eventually 
 Finale: SO SO SO beautiful. 
 Heart-warming in such a lovely way. Heart-warming is the perfect word to describe this book, If I am to choose only one word. It reminded me of why I read books. It's the FEELS, this zeal of emotion that completely washes over me after I finish a good book is the reason why I love reading. 
 Last bit: I was wondering about Julian's perspective when my friend told me about the two sequels for Wonder and one of them is ""Julian's chapter"" so no more wondering.. there I will find my answer :D","Sun Jun 29 15:06:25 -0700 2014","Fri Sep 18 15:10:01 -0700 2015","Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Thu Oct 02 00:00:00 -0700 2014",4,0,"True"

It is about August Pullman, who was born with mandibulofacial dysostosis. What that means is that he was born with a very misshapen and contorted face. Up until 5th grade, he was homeschooled because he was having surgeries to try and correct some of the facial abnormalities, but the surgeries did very little in making August look like a common 10-year-old boy. The story basically starts when it was decided that he should attend Beecher Prep School for the first time, starting in 5th grade. At school, kids were afraid to get near him and even ran to wash their hands if they came in contact with him, calling him a monster, ET or a mutant. However, there are always those who step up and Jack and Summer friended August. The teachers, along with several children and his sister Via, helped August find his way in his new world. 
 One of the teachers taught precepts in his class, that is rules about important things. One being: When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.

Looking deeper, we see that they both offer much to us in terms of teaching us what it is to be human-truly human-in an inhumane world. 
 My own complaint was that it contained (yet another) dead dog. I think keeping Daisy alive would not have hurt the storyline at all. 
 Wonder (and Out Of My Mind)should be placed on every classroom and school library shelf. Highly recommended.

Unfortunately, it put me to sleep more then knock me off my feet. I found it no more heartwarming, endearing or thought provoking then the story of Peter Rabbit. I also found that the reactions, to Auggies appearance, by both his peers and adults was somewhat dated. I know childhood is a tough time with bullying, peer pressure etc but I do believe that children and adults are more aware of and less judgemental of the diversities within society. I believe this to be true when it comes to race, culture, colour, sexual orientation and of course those with special needs.

 310 pages. 
 Appetizer: Ten-year-old August ""Auggie"" Pullman is going to school for the first time in his life. He, his parents and his sister, Via, who is starting the ninth grade at a different school, are all nervous about this. Auggie's face looks different from those of other kids. Due to a one in several million chance of genetics, people stare at Auggie wherever he goes. 
 Despite the fact that his parents, the principal, and some of the teachers and students try to create a welcoming environment for Auggie at Beecher Prep, Auggie still faces bullying, questions and betrayals from his classmates who fear being near him. At times, Auggie will want nothing more than to return to homeschooling. 
 What a powerhouse of a book with such a moving story! Experiences of love and loss, kindness and cruelty, and devotions and betrayals abound. With content related to science (genetics), social studies (Ancient Egypt) and messages about bullying, acceptance and being kind, this is a great classroom read for 4th-6th graders. 
 Wonder is an allusion-rich text. I found myself wishing I'd watched all six of the Star Wars movies more recently so I could know exactly what Auggie was describing. There are also references to The Wizard of Oz, The Hobbit, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, Our Town, and a particularly powerful reference to the Cheese Touch from Diary of a Wimpy Kid, that truly demonstrates how ostracized Auggie was during the first part of fifth grade: 
 Tristan didn't even care about the spilled powder on the floor or that he ruined the experiment. What he was most concerned about was getting to the lab sing to wash his hands as fast as possible. That's when I knew for sure that there was this thing about touching me at Beecher Prep. 
 I think it's like the Cheese Touch in Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The kids in that story were afraid they'd catch the cooties if they touched the old moldy cheese on the basketball court. At Beecher Prep, I'm the old moldy cheese."" (p. 72) 
 Yikes! And very moving! The way Palacio and Auggie describe his classmate's behaviors ring true. This book can be a very upsetting mirror for some readers' behaviors. (But don't worry, this metaphorical mirror doesn't always reveal the worst of ourselves. Palacio does a great job of showing the complexity and varied natured of a lot of the characters' struggles.) 
 I was rather surprised when I reached Part II of Wonder and I realized that the book jumped to Auggie's sister's point of view (and in later parts to those of some of both siblings' classmates). I wanted to stay with Auggie! But, the more I read, I saw the importance of seeing different characters' perspectives and motives. 
 Also, I'm rather fond of Wonder's booktrailer. You can watch that here: 
 Here's also a Publisher's Weekly article describing how support for Wonder has lead Random House Children's Books to launch an online anti-bullying campaign called Choose Kind. 
 Dinner Conversation: 
 ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go."" (p. 3) 
 ""'I don't want to go to school,' I answered, folding my arms. 
 ""It would be good for you, Auggie,"" said Mom. 
 ""Maybe I'll go next year,"" I answered, looking out the window. 
 ""This year would be better, Auggie,"" said Mom. ""You know why? Because you'll be going into fifth grade, and that's the first year of middle school--for everyone. You won't be the only new kid."" 
 ""I'll be the only kid who looks like me,"" I said. 
 ""I'm not going to say it won't be a big challenge for you, because you know better than that,"" she answered. ""But it'll be good for you, Auggie. You'll make lots of friends. Any you'll learn things you'd never learn from me."" (p. 12) 
 ""They were just being normal dumb kids. I know that. I kind of wanted to tell them that. Like, it's okay, I know I'm weird-looking, take a look, I don't bite. Hey, the truth is, if a Wookiee started going to the school all of a sudden, I'd be curious, I'd probably stare a bit! And if I was walking with Jack or Summer, I'd probably whisper to them: Hey, there's the Wookiee. And if the Wookiee caught me saying that, he'd know I wasn't trying to be mean. I was just pointing out the fact that he's a Wookiee."" (p. 62) 
 ""For me, Halloween is the best holiday in the world. It even beats Christmas. I get to dress up in a costume. I get to wear a mask. I get to go around like every other kid with a mask and nobody thinks I look weird. Nobody takes a second look. Nobody notices me. Nobody knows me. 
 I wish every day could be Halloween. We could all wear masks all the time. Then we could walk around and get to know each other before we got to see what we looked like under the masks."" (p. 73) 
 ""August is the Sun. Me and Mom and Dad are planets orbiting the Sun. The rest of our family and friends are asteroids and comets floating around the planets orbiting the Sun. The only celestial body that doesn't orbit August the Sun is Daisy the dog, and that's only because to her little doggy eyes, August's face doesn't look very different from any other human's face.""

 I adored the simplicity of characters more human than we could ever imagine in fictional worlds and a story that warms me to the bottom of my soul. 
 August ""Auggie"" is neither special nor wonderful - what he is is different; in ways that outwardly look different to other people. 
 But he doesn't see himself that way - he sees someone who loves star wars; is kind of a geek; adores his family and loves his dog. He also has the same insecurities that other kids have; and honestly if he hadn't been described physically at the start of the book; I wouldn't hhave even known that he was different. 
 And when THIS realization hit me; I knew what I had in my hands was a gem of a book - for the author did the unthinkable - they made sure that we as readers understood Auggie for him and not for his physical attributes! 
 Wonderfully and beautifully done - can't wait to watch the movie in November! <3

 The dog dies. 
 Shew. I feel better now that I've given you all the opportunity to prepare yourselves. 
 Honestly, I adored this book. The chapters are approximately 2 pages long, and the sections are divided up among central characters. Thankfully, though, August serves as the bookends to this book--he opens and closes it in a way. It's a lovely book about overcoming challenges out of our control and how people approach those challenges differently. Nothing about this book is obvious; nothing hits you over the head (except the above ""spoiler""). Instead, you are almost courted with the author's soft, subtle descriptions, gentle and believable dialogue, and characterization that was just so spot-on.

 It is difficult to summarize this book. You could say it about the external face we show the world, versus who we believe we are inside. It is about being different and wanting to be normal. It is about families and friendships. It is about the difficulties of middle school.

 Touching, heart-warming, and uplifting. I mean, I wouldn't say that this book perhaps deserves all of the hype that it is getting, but it is most definitely a really amazing read. I liked the looks into not just this boy, but most everyone around him and how their lives worked, and how Auggie's life did affect them. It might have been a tad on the overly optimistic side, but that doesn't really bother me all that much. I feel like in this type of book, I'd much rather read this type of story than a supremely depressing one. Anyway, I really, really enjoyed this book, it just didn't completely blow me away as much as I may have wanted. 
 August's face is not ""normal."" The specifics aren't important, but many would call him very ugly and deformed. This story is about his fifth grade year, his first time in a real, physical school, and the lives of everyone else around him during this time.

 So I think my favorite character may have been Miranda, and that's not to say that I agreed with all of her decisions or anything, but I just liked her. I liked that she did kind of try new things, even though it may not have ended up perfectly, she did try. And I liked how close she was with Auggie, despite it all, and how she cared about him a lot, even when she and Via had separated a little bit. When she called him I may have literally ""aww""ed. I also loved that she let Via go on instead of her when she saw everyone who had come for her. I just really liked her, which surprised me because when we were first exposed to her character I was definitely wary. 
 I also liked that we saw that life for Via was also kind of crappy sometimes. Like, Auggie is going to get most of the attention in the family, and that makes sense, he is in a tough place. But she also has bad times and he can't always be before her, and I also really liked that whole part of the book where she didn't want to tell her parents because she didn't want to be defined by Auggie. And that makes sense, I also wouldn't want to be defined by my siblings (though sometimes I think it's kind of inevitable) and I think her feelings are totally valid, but it is also totally valid for Auggie to feel a little betrayed by that. In my personal opinion, I would say that her feeling should have been slightly more respected in this instance (though that would have ruined the ending) just because she's been looked over so many times. 
 Okay, it was very odd to me that the boy on the cover has about three features (all of which are normal) and two of which are the very two features that Auggie hates the most. It loses some of it's validity in regards to his appearance. Like, that Auggie feels like his ears are super ugly (and it is pointed out multiple times that they look NOTHING like normal ears) is a fairly important part, and I feel like if a cover is going to have the face of a character who's face is very infamously not normal, you want to make the face on said cover very obviously not normal. It just wasn't... what I would have been looking for. Based on the cover before I read this book, I would have thought that he had one eye, two ears, and then the rest of his face was scarred over or something. This is not the case. Anyway, that was an overly long paragraph, I just didn't like that facet. 
 I know this is a middle-grade book and I should take my hopelessly romantic teenage brain out of it, but I ship Jack and Summer so badly. 
 I felt like Summer was really impressive, just because she wasn't asked to or assumed to hang out with or be at all kind to Auggie, but she went ahead and did so with such kindness. I did want her to be a little more in depth, for her to have a couple more dimensions than ""that nice girl."" I think she just deserved a little bit more to her character. 
 I really liked Auggie's mom and dad. I really, really understood how his mother felt a lot of the time and it was also very easy to understand his dad. It made both of their perspectives, even when they changed their minds constantly. It would be so, so very difficult to make decisions for a kid who was in such a difficult position. 
 I did want to hurt Julian's mom. She was horrible, and so was Julian. I disliked them, and I really wasn't up for him trying to ""start over"" or something, he frustrated me enough and I wasn't ready to forgive him all that quickly. 
 I think that the amount of ""mean"" that the kids were was fairly realistic. I think that the students reactions were very natural, some people have said that they thought that they should have been meaner, but I felt like that was how it would have worked. That's how it's always worked when I've been in classes with people who have some kind of mental disability (which I know is very different that how it is with Auggie, but it's the closest comparison I have.) 
 I really liked Mr. Tushman, he just seemed very kind and understanding. And I liked Mrs. G when she wasn't smiling her ""shiny smile"", as Auggie called it. 
 And the ending just made me happy. It was sweet and he got his standing ovation and it was all beautiful and happy and I cried tears of joy.

The book cover portrays it very well indeed. The story revolves around August aka Auggie who is going to attend school for the first time ever in 5th grade. There are episodes of bullying, other children at the school avoiding him, whispering when his back is turned and treating him like he is mentally ill. 
 ""They would take the longest way around me to avoid bumping into me in any way, like I had some germ they could catch, like my face was contagious."" 
 But he is merely a child with a facial deformity. He struggles with making friends, even though he is funny and smart at studies. 
 I loved reading this book. Why? Because, first of all, it's hard not to adore Auggie...he is such a sweet kid. His character is so beautifully written that I was instantly taken by him. Secondly, the author goes on to say that the book is based on a real story of a girl in front of the ice cream shop (no names specified). But the author's dedication is so heartfelt that you could feel it throughout the book. Thirdly, it feels unreal, hard to imagine a deformed face, yet not so fictional. In one way or another..we all have been bullied, called names and pressurized to surrender to societal norms and conventions. And lastly, it was an easy read. The writing style is simple and from multiple POVs (mostly kids). 
 I wouldn't be telling you all if the story has a happy ending or not, but it is definitely worth reading - it makes us question our beliefs and behavior, how many times we hurt people by our words and actions and what it feels like to be picked on if you are different in any way.

 Wonderful 5 stars ***** 
 Before I say anything else, let me confess, I Ammara Abid, wholeheartedly love this book. 
 A big hand for R.J. Palacio for such an excellent write-up. This book hit me, it hit me hard. I can't explain in words the effect of 'Wonder' on me. I was completely awestruck. 
 I know it's a fiction but what an inspiring fiction it is! 
 Based on the bitter reality of our society and aspired from a little incident in real life. 
 It would urge you to stop and look around, 
 It would urge you to feel, 
 It would urge you to think, 
 to think about the special kids, 
 It would urge you to 
 'Be HUMAN' 
 & 
 'Be HUMANE'. 
 Most of the time tears rolling down my cheeks and yet no time to stop. The story is so moving, touching and gripping it grab your attention. There's no way out. You can't put it down. You can't. That's it. 
 Auggie 'the wonder boy' the main character of the book, the story revolves around it but what makes it more amazing is the narration. Not only narrated by Auggie but Via, Summer, Justin, Jack & Miranda too. 
 In the end when the Mr. Tushman announced the final award, Henry Ward Beecher medal, not only his friends cried out loud but me too with tears in my eyes and smile on my face 
 'a happy crying' :"") 
 I love all the characters and their perspectives. The way story is being told is cherry on the top. 
 Precisely, this book stole my heart. I love it's title too I love everything about it. 
 Do you want some wonderful read? 
 'Wonder' is your book to hold.

Everyone was telling me to read it and how great it is. I think there was no way this was going to live up to the hype for me. I also paused this book 2 or 3 times before I completed it for the bookbuddyathon. I thought I would of had a way more emotional connection to this book but I just didn't. I connected more with Via and Summer than August. I think switching the points of views so many times told a different story than I was expecting. It seemed to be not a story about August but about August and how his abnormality effects everyone in his life around him. I felt for Via being the older sister and constantly having her life revolve around her brother. I also loved Summer's story since she was the only kid at school in the whole story who was genuinely kind to August from the beginning, not because a teacher told her to. I also thought that it had a much more happy ending that was sort of unrealistic. What is going to happen to August when everyone starts dating? I also am conflicted on the message of ""If you have a choice to be right or be kind, always choose kind."" In this political climate with ""alternative facts"", that is a confusing message for adults let alone kids. I know this book was written before all of that but it is still confusing if you think about it to much. I think this is a good book for older elementary to read but you should read it with your child and discuss it, since it does go into the point of view of highschoolers and complicated issues. I believe in the message of judge people on what is within and not on the outside.

Maybe I'm just scarred by the bad experiences I've had with books that TRIED to get into the heads of really different people and failed to do it right. Or maybe I'm just afraid I'm going to cry too much. In any case, like Anything But Typical and Mockingbird (two of my favorite books in recent memory), Wonder was a book I took one look at, then promptly filled up with feelings of discomfort. (The fact that it wasn't a book about autism but a book about facial disfigurement didn't make a difference.) I thought it would be a manipulative tearjerker that belittled the experience of the truly different, and that bugged me. But the reviews came in and they all tripped over themselves trying to gush about this book. Elizabeth Bird said it was ""the one to beat"" on her 2013 Newbery Predictions list. Anything that has that kind of press is something that I, a diehard Newbery Prediction junkie, simply cannot resist. So I ran out and bought it, and in three quick reading sessions it became very apparent why this is the book everyone is talking about: It IS that good. 
 I love books that make me feel something. Preferably the kind of something that leaves me a sobbing empathetic wreck. This is one of those books. In the book's 300-odd pages are events that are so astoundingly cruel that I actually had to put the book down. I was actually so shaken by one event that I became too sad to cry, if you can imagine that. Yet, there are moments that made me cheer and moments that made me laugh out loud, two things I almost never do at books. You'll be dragged all over the place emotionally when you read this and, I think, you won't feel the least bit manipulated. 
 Truth be told, the book would've been really good even without the multiple points-of-view. The first eighty pages as narrated by Auggie were heartbreaking and moving enough, and the insight was already pretty strong. However, the story REALLY gets going when Via starts narrating, and it doesn't slow down. I don't agree with the reviews that state that some of the narrators were unnecessary. I loved all of these kids. Via, the fiercely protective and serious older sister who tries to break out of her family's solar system, Summer, the devoted friend, Jack, the friend who did wrong but was determined to make it right when he did, Justin, Via's hipster-in-the-making boyfriend (I REALLY liked him, I won't lie... he seemed a little bit of a daydreamer to me and his thing about the universe taking care of everyone reflected that), and Miranda, Via's former best friend and honorary big sister to Auggie, these were all a wonderful group of young people that prove that not every kid is ignorant. 
 (Side note: I don't think Julian's point-of-view should've been added like so many others do. Perhaps ironically, he would've been a misfit among all of these sweet, caring kids. That, and I absolutely didn't want to hear of any other horrible things his wretch of a mother said or did. Julian has the excuse of being an ignorant ten-year-old boy; his mother does not. Hearing any more from these ugly-on-the-inside people would've marred the book for me.) 
 Auggie himself is a wonder of protagonist and narrator. In all the Books Like This for the younger set that I've read, no protagonist has come close to being this self-aware and funny. I think if you're different, you HAVE to have a sense of humor about your plight no matter how bad you have it. It's a coping mechanism that works wonders, and it's great to see that he's developed it at such a young age when it takes some people entire lifetimes. It's also great that first-time author Palacio realized that even having a sense of humor about yourself doesn't mean other people can't hurt your feelings with horrible remarks. Finally, the best thing is that Auggie, though being a smart, sweet, and funny kid, still has flaws, like being self-centered. Having saintly protagonists makes a book insulting, and thanks to the skill with which Auggie was created, I don't think he's going to be an insulting character to anyone. He represents the outcast in all of us, but succeeds in being a cool kid in his own right. 
 Finally, the writing was just amazing. Deceptively simple, I'd say. Short chapters punch at the reader with matter-of-fact emotion. This is a much better tactic than describing the events with poetic metaphors and ""gorgeous"" writing. That stuff works for certain kinds of books, but it wouldn't have worked here. This is the kind of book that needs to be blunt, direct, and real. Fortunately, it was. 
 It's relatively early in the year, but this book is the frontrunner for the Newbery Medal already, and it deserves it. It should (and probably will) get the Schneider Award too. It deserves the latter because, quite frankly, this book could've fallen into so many disability book traps that it avoided (that and their picks recently have been... off). And it deserves the former because, frankly, this is a marvelous book that has giant, extremely important things to say about how we should treat each other. No other book this year will be able to top it for me. If you read only one book in 2012, make it Wonder. Thank you, R.J.

 As soon as the book starts you love Auggie he is very sweet and smart. And you want everything to go right at school. Of course it doesn't, and the kids are awful to him. And I can imagine this is exactly what would happen. It is written so realistically that you feel so sympathetic towards Auggie but you also smile when some of the kids are very kind to him, as they should be. 
 The whole book focused on the importance of kindness, towards everyone. It shows that friendships are important and that the most unlikely friendships can be the best ones. That if you really believe you can do something and stand behind that 100% that you will achieve it.","Thu Jul 06 08:57:29 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 25 08:22:38 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 25 08:22:38 -0700 2017","",1,0,"False"

 For me, this book doesn't have anything at all. But somehow as another book it is rated really high. And I can't understand why. 
 I have read a lot of children's books and they can be really great like this or that. But this one have nothing inside. 
 The plot seems to be extraordinary, but the protagonist is not someone you will like. And that has nothing to do with his appearance. He is just a little boy, he is not brave, he is not funny, he is not kind as the author tries to convince her readers. 
 Some events in the book happen without any logic, and some chapters are there I can't explain for what reason. 
 That's my first review of the book, so I can't express my opinion really well. But all I can see, this kind of book doesn't raise any emotion and doesn't fill my head with new, important ideas.","Mon Dec 02 08:04:41 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 05 12:20:20 -0800 2014","Mon Dec 02 08:42:09 -0800 2013","",4,1,""

I've been stuck on the same book for a month, finding it hard to get into, but decided to pick up 'Wonder', hoping it would give me a breath of fresh air; and it did. I was hooked from the first page. 
 The main character, August, is very lovable. He's a character you'll remember. But the other characters, many who were POVs, were also extremely great. They were all human, they all made mistakes and said stupid things, but I loved each and every one of them. Jack, Miranda, etc. They were interesting as people. 
 The only thing I would ""complain"" about is: the younger children spoke very maturely for their age. But you can forgive that because they're cute and witty. 
 'Wonder' is easily 5/5 stars. A new favorite, and a book that should be shared among everyone, especially children.","Mon Mar 10 06:28:45 -0700 2014","Sun Jan 04 22:42:54 -0800 2015","Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sat Nov 29 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0,""

Miranda--the former best friend of August's sister Olivia, spoke these words to Olivia's boyfriend, and no one at Beecher Middle School would argue with the truth of her statement. August, a fifth grader at Beecher, was born with a severe facial deformity, requiring twenty-seven surgeries before he was ten years old. Concerned about overprotecting their son, Auggie's parents decide that instead of home schooling, he should start attending school. After all, at the start of middle school, everyone is a new student. At first unenthusiastic, Auggie finally agrees to give it a try, armed with the knowledge that if it's too horrible he can give it up and go back to the safety of home. 
 Palacio's first novel is warm, funny, and full of, well, wonder, as Auggie experiences both expected cruelty and surprising kindness from the children in this private school in New York City. By shifting the narrative between Auggie and several other characters, Palacio helps readers witness not only Auggie's maturing courage, but also the growth of other students who learn to accept him as one of their own. This book is not a reflection of what life is like for a disabled student, but rather a glimpse of what it could be. What makes this work are the characters themselves. Although some characters fall into stereotypes--the inspiring English teacher, for example--most are richly imagined, dynamic, and at times flawed characters who don't always do the right thing, but mostly want to. Augie is not an angelic, always easy to love character, but is both courageous and at times a little self-centered. Violet is a loving sister who at times feels guilty for wanting a life without the complications his disfigurements bring. Jack is a friend who must make the choice between popularity and kindness--in middle school, no less. Palacio shows us what is possible when people courageously make this choice, without feeling dogmatic or preachy. Illuminating possibilities is the magic of fiction.

 -- Madeleine L'Engle 
 This is the second time I use this quote in a review. 
 Is it really a coincidence that the book I'd finished right before this one was ""Einstein and relativity""? 
 That the first chapter of Einstein and relativity was about how our brain works, that there is no such thing as red or blue, that there is a wavelength of 450 nm and a wavelength of 620 nm and our brain can't recognize them as frequencies and wavelength so it gives them definitions and sense of familiarity, so when you see a wavelength of 450 nm your brain instantly translate it to blue so you can recognize it. That the world is not what we see, that we're not so different from a blind man who forms his world through his four remaining senses. Truth is, our senses are incomplete. 
 Another concept, relativity, is that there is no such thing as an absolute thing, we compare everything to something else, to understand anything you have to compare it to something else to understand it's nature, giving an example ""What if we all fell asleep and everything got 10X bigger, the room, our feet, the books near our bed, our pillows. If we wake up in the morning, we won't notice any difference, because to us, everything is still the same, our pajamas still fits, we can still hold the book in our hands and we're smaller than the wardrobe"" 
 Why did this cross my mind while reading wonder? It's because I had a simple question, what makes us think he's deformed? Because we compare him to others, because to a 1 year old Auggie wasn't any different than any 10 year old, but to a grown up, he makes the comparison in his head and decides that he's ugly. But aren't we plain blind? who says what we see is real? who says that any of what we see is real? that what we see is actually beautiful? If we are all actually deformed, how do we know that we are? 
 We just make distinguishable patterns in our head so we can know the way back home but what's home? something that our eyes can't always distinguish but our heart does, our soul does, but what's the soul anyhow? something that our brains can't distinguish but knows it exists. 
 It's not a novel about self pity or trying to send a moral message, it's a novel about real people, a real 10 year old kid, who's not being a hero, who's not absorbed into a self pity 
 I didn't learn anything from Auggie and I didn't learn to be more sympathetic or to be grateful for what I already have. But it softened my heart. Dunno if it was the reason why I have been having those flashbacks for the past two days or so. 
 Proving as well, that my life is a series of coincidences. 
 The book on its own level deserves five stars. Along with the little prince and 13 reasons why. 
 Such a delightful blue book.","Mon Jan 07 11:26:43 -0800 2013","Sun Jun 22 11:17:48 -0700 2014","Sat Apr 27 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,0,""

 Auggie was the cutest character ever, I just wanted to bundle him up and squeeze him. It was really refreshing to read about a character who obviously has a lot more issues and problems than your average Joe, but who is still such a happy-go-lucky type of person. He's still such a happy boy, he takes things in his stride, he tries his hardest not to let other people get him down and it's not often you see that in books. It's so easy for him to become a recluse and hide away and become depressed, but I'm so thankful this story wasn't like that.

How teachers, fellow students and other parents react to Auggie's presence ranges a wide spectrum, from awkward to cruel, to benevolent and even heroic. Told from various character perspectives, Auggie's courage in the wake of cruelty from children and adults alike, transforms those closest to him.

It is one of those rare bestsellers that is truly wonderful. While it's about a fifth grader with a severe facial deformity, and the struggles he faces when entering a school for the first time, it's much broader than that and really captures the struggles of growing up and the difficult years of Middle School and early High School. It deals with many difficult topics in a sensitive and realistic way that can't help but cause readers to become emotionally attached to the wonderful family at the heart of the book. 
 The novel is told from a number of perspectives, but the Pullman siblings dominant the narrative. They were also the strongest and most sincere voices. When some of the periphery characters take over, I found their voices to be less authentic and a little more forced, but their insight to the story was crucial for the instilling the sense of empathy that young readers should develop while reading this book.

A ten-year-old boy with severe facial deformities goes to school for the first time. This does not sound like a read-aloud winner. 
 But after the first few chapters, including a humorous ""the day you were born story"" of a rude farting nurse, it was clear this was going to be the one. 
 This book is such an excellent match of believable and likable characters and a plot that keeps you moving through the book without being sensational. The author does a superb job of telling a story of this boy and his family by using multiple perspectives (each section is told from the POV of a different child, including the main character, Augggie's, sister, sister's friend, sister's boyfriend, and a few kids from Auggie's school). 
 This book is funny, touching without being schmaltzy, and forces you to grow and think as a reader. What more can you ask for? 
 The only thing that felt unreal was the character's age. Auggie and his peers acted and talked much more like kids in 7th or 8th grade, but who knows, maybe I have a warped sense of age. 
 This is a great book because it will have broad appeal to many ages, I imagine. My only question: how do you convince a young or older teen to pick up this book? I'll be curious to know the non-adult responses.

At age ten, he goes to school for the first time in his life. It was a very unique experience to look through the eyes of someone with a problem like that, which I haven't had really any experience with at all. The way that he deals with all the stares and gasps when people see him was one of the most interesting things that I noticed in this book. He found patterns in the way that people would look at him, and how they would react. In my opinion, the author did a very good job of creating a window for us to see what it is like to suffer from a deformity like that. 
 One of the things that I didn't like about this book was her lack of difference between characters. There are several sections in this book, and each of them are in the point of view of a new character. This was a good idea to switch point of views between Auggie and the people in his life, but I found myself thinking that they all sounded the same. She made their thoughts, and their ""Voices"" sound identical, and it was hard to distinguish between them all. This said, she had a very good grasp on what its like to live like Auggie, and I think that every kid should know how hard that is. 
 I would recommend this book to children between 10 and 15 as its main age range, but I think that adults would enjoy it just as much.","Mon Mar 10 13:26:58 -0700 2014","Sat Mar 15 11:50:22 -0700 2014","Fri Mar 14 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Mon Mar 10 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 WONDER is (mostly) wonderful. Heartfelt. Inspiring. A feel-good read in large part because the book does not convey ONLY ""feel-good"" moments. Of course, inasmuch as the book has become a bestseller since its February 2012 publication, plenty of readers (adult and child alike) have already met the memorable Auggie Pullman for themselves. 
 So, who is Auggie Pullman? 
 Well, let's let Auggie begin introducing himself: ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go."" 
 ""...My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 Whatever we're thinking???? It's probably worse?? Yikes. This isn't going to be just any ol' story of any ol' kid starting school now, is it. 
 Cuz, as I just hinted, this is a book about a ten-year-old boy, who is about to be the new kid at school. Middle school, that is. Fifth grade, to be precise, at Beecher Prep. A kid who has never ever been to any school before. 
 Well, why not? ""People think I haven't gone to school because of the way I look, but it's not that. It's because of all the surgeries I've had. Twenty-seven since I was born. The bigger ones happened before I was even four years old, so I don't remember those. But I've had two or three surgeries every year since then (some big, some small), and because I'm little for my age, and I have some other medical mysteries that doctors never really figured out, I used to get sick a lot."" 
 But Auggie's done for a while with surgeries, and he's stronger. So, at last he can attend school. A dream come true, finally? Well, wait a sec: "" I can't say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn't exactly be true."" 
 So then, what is true? ""What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like any other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and hang out after school and stuff like that."" Oh. 
 Hmm. But Auggie's our hero, and yeah, he's got a face that startles people, but he's been brave with all those surgeries, so he'll be fine with the school idea, right? Uh, well, nope! He's ""pretty much totally and completely petrified."" Petrified or not, he does end up at school and the story is off and running. 
 How will the year go? Will Auggie's fears prove groundless? How will so many new people encountering him for the first time react? How will Auggie cope? And will he get his wish to have friends like other kids ""and hang out after school and stuff like that"" ?? 
 Auggie is not the only one who tells the story. Surprisingly, multiple characters get a chance to weigh in: classmates like Jack and Summer, his sister Via, his sister's old friend Miranda, his sister's boyfriend Justin. These shifting points of view allow the reader to get a fuller perspective on events, though Auggie himself begins and ends the story. 
 And, to borrow and mangle Shakespeare a bit, the course of true [middle school], never did run smooth -- for anyone and especially for Auggie. 
 But by the time the last word is read, many readers will probably agree that their hearts and minds feel fuller. 
 And they will miss Auggie, the boy who thinks ""everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in ... life ""

So many of the reactions and characters in the novel seem very real and I absolutely loved it.","Tue Nov 26 23:02:51 -0800 2013","Mon Sep 08 20:52:03 -0700 2014","Sun Aug 31 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sun Aug 31 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"False"

He has always been homeschool, but the story starts when his parents decide he should attend a private middle-school. Most of the kids are afraid to go near him for fear of catching ""The Plague"" and some are outright hostile, but August does manage to make a couple of friends who help him get through the year. 
 What I liked: I really appreciated what the author was trying to do--get kids to see that even when people look different or even scary, they are just people like you and me. I loved the message of being kind, and I liked how Palacio showed how August's condition affected his family and friends. I could emphasize with the good and bad choices each character made when I understood what it was like for them to have August in their life. 
 What I had a problem with: I had a hard time getting emotionally attached to the characters and I think the problem was the 'voice.' Though each section was from the point of view from a different character, they all sounded the same. The dialogue too . . . most of it sounded too adult with some kid slang like 'dude' or 'dissed' thrown it to make it seem juvenile. And way to much use of ""I know, right?"" from most of the characters. I can't help but compare this to Firegirl which really had me emotionally involved . . . something that I felt missing in this book.","Sun Jan 29 14:01:41 -0800 2012","Sun Jan 29 14:02:08 -0800 2012","Sun Jan 29 14:02:07 -0800 2012","",3,1,""

 I am a 6th grade teacher. Let me state upfront, that the only reason I read this book was because it had been selected for our 5th and 6th grade book club. I tend to prefer adventure, fantasy, or horror, so this was way out of my genre of preference. Compounding my reluctance to read this book, was the subject matter. I can't stand intentionally sad books. When I first read about the condition of the main character's face, I expected the story to focus on all the bullying...all the unfair treatment...all the heartache that Auggie, the main character, experienced, everything that further painted a picture of the fallen state of the human condition. And while, it had some of these aspects, they only served to highlight the book's overriding themes of hope and courage. 
 In the end, I found this story wasn't so much about Auggie, as it was about the condition of my own heart and what I want this heart to look like to my students and my own children. I think if we are being honest, we all carry a little Auggie inside of us. We are all afraid of failure and what others might think of us when we do. I know for sure that each one of my students wears a space helmet from time to time, embarrassed by one perceived shortcoming or another. But hopefully, when they read this book, they will be encouraged like I was. They will see that if Auggie can be brave enough to live his life in the face of what others might think, there is no excuse for any of us. Maybe then, they too will be free to live their lives with a renewed sense of wonder.

 Ultimately, it was a unique and touching perspective on the triumphs and troubles of the middle school years.

Even Julian gets a hint at a better future, when the precept he sends his teacher the summer before he starts at a new school is, ""Sometimes it's good to start over."" I know that Julian was not at all sympathetic, but I always prefer it when villains--if you can call a ten-year-old boy a villain--have a chance at redemption. I liked the optimistic outlook, and I liked the way the different POVs meshed together to form an interesting, three-dimensional story. 
 There were only a couple of things I didn't like. 
 One of them was that the book kind of bashed you over the head with its message, but since it seems this is an MG book and not the YA book I was expecting, I guess I can forgive a bit of non-subtlety (which isn't to say that you can't write an MG book with a subtle message, but it's not really expected as much as it is in YA and adult fiction). 
 The other thing I didn't like was, unfortunately, the ending. I was feeling good enough about this book that I expected to end it on a high emotional note, and while I did walk away from it feeling contemplative and, overall, pretty happy, the ending fell rather flat for me. 
 Frankly, Auggie's winning the award just didn't ring true the way most of the rest of the book did. It felt... false, almost. I feel a little bad saying that, because Auggie is an admirable character, but let me explain. 
 The award he won was the ""Henry Ward Beecher medal to honor students who have been notable or exemplary in certain areas throughout the school year,"" and the passage the principal uses to explain his giving the award to Auggie is this: ""He is the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own."" The way I see it, this refers to the way Auggie's courage and kindness had a profoundly positive influence on all of his classmates. 
 Except... that didn't happen. Don't get me wrong; Auggie was a brave, considerate, and endearing character, and I was impressed with how well he dealt with his situation. But only a few of his classmates were actually influenced by him--by who he was--and, when that happened, he was just as influenced by their strength of character as they were by his. And yes, by the end of the book the majority of his classmates were feeling more kindly toward him, but that was mostly because of his run-in with the seventh graders at the nature retreat, which gave him and his classmates a common enemy--it made them feel as if he was one of them, and that one of them was being attacked by an outsider--and in which he, frankly, didn't actually do anything outstanding. 
 So, in the end, it seemed to me as if Auggie was given the award for what he was--a kid with a facial deformity who's had a rough time of it--and not who he was. And that, frankly, seems like a total departure from everything the book was very thorough in trying to teach us. Maybe other people interpret this scene differently, and that's fine, but that's the way it came off to me. 
 Furthermore--and this probably isn't true for a lot of people--I don't like it when the high point of a book consists of the main character gaining the approval of the masses. It would have felt a lot more satisfying and fulfilling to me if the ending was focused on Auggie looking around and seeing the small group of people who, over the course of the book, have learned to truly love him for who he is, instead of a bunch of people applauding him because the tides of popular opinion have turned in his favor (or is that just me being cynical?). This way just... didn't seem to live up to the rest of the story. 
 Overall, though, I did quite like this book, and if I ever see it sitting on a bookstore shelf when I have a few extra dollars in my pocket, I'll be sure to grab it for my collection.","Tue Aug 13 23:50:50 -0700 2013","Mon Dec 08 06:27:15 -0800 2014","Tue Aug 13 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"True"

They added so much dimension to the story and I felt like I really understood all sides of August's story - except maybe his parents. 
 Now for August himself. He was such an enthralling character and the things he did made me reflect on my own life and actions. The last line was just perfect ""She bent down and whispered in my ear. 'You really are a wonder, Auggie. You are a wonder.'"" (310 Palacio). The way he handled everything including his horrible luck in the gene pool really moved me. He was only in the 5th grade and he already had to experience things many people don't have to deal with their whole lives. He knows both sides of the coin of the human existence and truly doesn't blame people for how they treat him. He only gets visibly upset when people aren't truthful with him which is a trait I admire. 
 I really liked how Palacio didn't try and sugar-coat anything. Like with Olivia, she said it how it is. This is a truly original novel that doesn't flinch in the face of truth. The book could make the world a better place (I know I'm so dramatic!) :D

 Te hace pensar, te hace recapacitar. Sobretodo cuando Narra el propio August, sus pensamientos, sus observaciones sobre el resto de gente que le dedica miradas de odio, asco... te hace darte cuenta de muchas cosas.

August is an amazing character he was so adorable, but also such a wise person for someone his age. His parents and their love for August was something that really loved. It was very beautiful how much they love and care for him. His sister Via and Summer and Jack too. The students and Beecher prep as well. I fell in love with so many of the characters in this book 
 It's already hard to make friends in middle school and August has an even tougher time doing that because of his rare birth defect that affects the way his face looks. People give one look at him and they're turning the other way, or stealing glances at him without even trying to get to know him. But once they do. Once they get the courage to strike up a conversation they realize that's he's just another ordinary kid, a hilarious and intelligent kid, who just, happens to look a little different from everyone else. 
 This story really touched my heart I was crying tears of both happiness and sadness throughout the book and I absolutely recommend this book to everyone, whether they are a boy or a girl, an adult or a kid. It's the kind of story that is hard to find and it teaches a great message and I think everyone should read it and experience Auggie's story because they won't regret it. 
 ""There are always going to be jerks in the world, Auggie,"" she said, looking at me. ""But I really believe, and Daddy really believes, that there are more good people on this earth than bad people, and the good people watch out for each other and take care of each other.""

 If I weren't a 35 year old woman reviewing this book, but the 9 Plus (it's children's, not even YA?) the review would be different. 
 But I am, so there we are. 
 Although I enjoyed the flow and overall ""goodness"" of the story, the plot line had some huge issues. 
 The school that's *perfect* for Auggie just happened to be down the block. is too conviently located, especially when Via goes to a school that's much further away. Not sure why this bugged me so much. 
 A 5th grade gratuation? Wrong. They aren't even changing schools an they get a gratuation ceremony? Possibly every year? Moving on. 
 This was a set up for 2. where Auggie basically gets an award for having a facial deformity, acknowledges this, and it's okay with him. 
 Most importantly, while Auggie's parents taught him to deal with other's meanness by laughing, they didn't teach him any other methods. 
 Any tensions are resolved by laughter or simply ending the scene/writing off of a character. Get beaten up and have your hearing aids stolen? It's okay, don't tell anyone. But teachers will learn about it and then all the kids in school will love you. Odd. 
 This makes me sound like I really hated the book, and I didn't. I always enjoy the mutliple POV story (although in this case, they all had similar styles of voice) and would have glazed over much of these issues I was the target audience.","Wed May 16 18:41:26 -0700 2012","Fri May 31 12:04:38 -0700 2013","Wed May 29 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

I was afraid it would seem too redundant, telling the story from all those points of view, but Palacio really did a great job moving the story forward and not dwelling too much on what we already know.

This is the story of a boy, August, who is born with a severly deformed face. At the age of ten, his parents decide to try sending him to school for the first time. This decision not only puts August out into the spotlight, but also changes the life of his sister and his new friends. 
 I loved Auggie. Yes, I admit that maybe at times his thoughts sounded more like the adult author speaking than a ten year old boy, but I don't care. I'm willing to believe there could really be a boy like Auggie. 
 I know this is getting a lot of Newbery hype, and I must admit I'm hesitant. The story itself is so heart-lifting that it at first seems to be an obvious choice. I'm not sure about the writing, though. I'm not sure if it's good enough for the Newbery. The writing flows very well, but some of the narrator's voices felt forced and artificial. I know Palacio was trying to give each character a unique voice, but it came across as a little gimmicky to me. That's the one big thing that's keeping me from screaming Newbery (though, really, I would be very happy if I does end up winning). 
 But I will say that between this and The One and Only Ivan, this year is turning out to be a excellent year for children's literature.","Mon Apr 02 17:21:30 -0700 2012","Wed Apr 04 17:42:34 -0700 2012","Wed Apr 04 17:42:34 -0700 2012","Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,4,""

 One of my bookish new year's resolution is to write book reviews that consist of more than just crying and screaming, so here we go! 
 It's really tough to buy in Poland the books I want to read in English version. So when I noticed this one among copies of '50 Shades of Grey' and countless supernatural romances which usually fill the English sections in bookstores, I didn't hesitate even one second. I'm so happy that I started my reading year with such a brilliant book! 
 The story follows August - a child born with severe facial abnormality. He already endured a lot, people staring, pointing, talking about him all the time. Yet, he find himself in the toughest situation so far - after years of being home-schooled he's about to attend school like every other child. Middle school is tough for every child, but no one has it as tough as him. 
 Things I loved: 
 -August! Such a lovely and kind kid, I admired that he had his better and worse days but he always managed to stay optimistic and found ways to laugh and live a life of a normal kid as much as he could. I can't fully enjoy a book if I don't connect with the main character and thankfully August caught my heart from the first chapter. 
 -The POV changes. It usually annoys me a lot but in this book it was probably the most interesting part for me. It made it possible to see the whole situation from different perspectives, to see August through different eyes, not only his family but people from the outside as well. 
 -Via, August's sister. Her POV was the most heart-breaking to read. Caught between loving her brother and wanting to be recognized for being herself, not only her brother's sister, her chapters felt the most realistic too me. 
 -Pullman family dynamics. They were so lovely, trustful and honest with each other even when it was tough. It made my heart melt :))) 
 -Star Wars references!!! I saw the newest movie last week so I'm all for anything Star Wars in every amounts, haha! 
 Things I didn't love: 
 -A bit too sweet. It felt unrealistic at times. 
 -I kind of wish there was a chapter from Justin's (the bullying one) POV to see that was inside his head and add a different layer to the story. 
 In overall, I wish everyone read this book, it's a kind of message that will be always needed.","Sat Nov 07 14:13:46 -0800 2015","Fri Dec 30 12:59:35 -0800 2016","Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Thu Dec 31 00:00:00 -0800 2015",8,3,"False"

 I cried and laughed with this book and I couldn't put it down. The chapters are short, which lends itself to a good read-aloud book.

After watching the Bully movie, and since we have instituted a bullying prevention program at school, I was hyper-aware of bullying at this point. This book gives an implicit view of it with someone who has a physical deformity. I lost it at the line, ""Mommy, why am I so ugly?"" I really felt for him then and through the rest of the book. Good story arc which kept a good pace.

When he opts to attend school for his fifth grade year, he is worried about being tormented by his peers. While much of the expected bullying occurs, his middle school experience proves to be much richer - and more pleasant - than Auggie ever imagined. 
 This heartwarming novel is divided into sections narrated by August himself, his older sister, Via, some of his sister's friends, and some of his own classmates. In straightforward prose, the characters explain how they see Auggie, and how Auggie experiences the world. References to Star Wars, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Justin Bieber place the story squarely in the present day and contribute to an overall feeling that August is just like other ten-year-old boys in all the ways that count. The emotions experienced by each character, and their ways of expressing them are very real, and every major character is sympathetic, even some of the ones who treat Auggie poorly. 
 For much of the story, the author succeeds in conveying an important message without a hint of preachiness, but sadly, she ruins this effect in the final chapters by singling Auggie out as special just because of his condition. While most of the book captures the fifth grade experience perfectly, and will appeal to kids who see themselves in the characters, this over-the-top Hallmark movie ending is too saccharine to feel believable to anyone except adults with an overly romanticized view of childhood and a mistaken belief that bullies are softened by kindness. 
 Based on all the hype surrounding it, I was surprised when Wonder didn't win the Newbery in 2013.

 Wonder is a story about Auggie, a boy born with a facial deformity, and his struggle to find a place to fit in as he attends a mainstream school for the first time in fifth grade. The point of view switches between various children, from Via, his sister, to Jack, a fellow classmate in his fifth grade class. And it is these perspectives that you gain a deeper understanding of not only the kindness that everyone possesses, but also the cruelty that we are all capable of. There were some situations in this story that just rang so true, and any reader will find someone that they will be able to connect with. 
 Overall, it's a uplifting story about just being yourself, owning up to your mistakes, and learning that it's important to be kinder than is necessary.

He had loving parents and sister, and a wonderful dog named Daisy. Due to numerous surgeries, August had been home schooled. But, that was all going to change as he enters 5th grade! 
 Auggie can't understand why his parents are ""making"" him go to Beecher Prep. Why did he have to be around people all the time? People who would stare, make faces, make ugly comments. But, Auggie was likeable and did make some friends, the best of whom were Summer and Jack Will. But then, there were those others! Come along and learn about 5th grade with Auggie. Meet his Director, Mr. Pullman; his teacher, Mr. Brown, who teaches them Precepts during English; his parents, his sister ""Via,"" and the other students in the school.

 ""You can't blend in when you were born to stand out."" This is one of my favorite lines in the book.

 Auggie Pullman is a boy with a cranial anomaly, meaning his face is genetically deformed thanks to a 1:4,000,000 chance of chromosomes matching up. Previously home-schooled, it is now time for Auggie to enter the fifth grade in a normal school, with all of the middle school drama that comes with it. Well, even more so for Auggie. A tale of friendship and kindness overcoming ignorance and bullying, this is a great book for everyone to read. 
 I had heard so much about this novel before picking it up in the store. I even heard RJ Palancio speak at a conference about writing the book and her inspiration for it. Now that I have actually bought it, I can tell you it certainly lives up to the hype. I thought I knew what to expect from a book about middle school kids picking on a new kid who was different, but the style of writing made it a million times better than what I was expecting. Not only do you get Auggie's story, but you also get the points of view from other family members, kids at school, the works (even with some chapters written in emails and text messages thrown in). It is a very cool novel to read. You should get on it.

 Auggie is ugly, ""deformed"", but if you really get to KNOW him, he is beautiful, in ""every single way"", and the blending of the perspective of other characters (have seen this technique used many, many times) was important. 
 When you look at Justin's life, or Miranda's life from their own perspective, and don't limit Justin's life to Via's perspective, or limit Miranda's life to Via's perspective, you see Auggie in a brand new light, a brand new perspective. 
 And the thing is, you can't really see yourself, and I can't really see myself as dynamically as you & I can see Auggie after this book because we don't necessarily have the perspective of all the people around us about us, even if we know them, are in relationship with them. We are, and they are too complicated. 
 And that is hard because we don't have an accurate viewpoint of ourselves, not as accurate as the reader has of Auggie after the book is over. 
 Because we were able to see Auggie from Via's perspective, and from Justin's perspective, and Jack's perspective, and Summer's perspective ... and we see bravery and cowardice in Jack's character & Summer's character.

 Wonder 
 was undoubtedly a memorably read. Between the narrative and the narrative structure and the book's message, it could very well have been phenomenal for me. But it wasn't. It felt to me like a great piece of art with lots of nice parts that didn't fit together enough to merge into one great piece of absolute beauty. Well, something like this. I love that the narrative bounced between characters, allowing us to see what it was like, not just for Auggie, but for all the people affected by Auggie's facial abnormality - even though I appreciated some narratives more than others. It was important to read about the perspectives of some of the people directly and indirectly influenced by him. I definitely loved the themes that inspire one to exercise simple human virtues like patience and kindness. The contrast made between middle school and high school life as Auggie and his sister, Via, try to fit in their respective schools was also something of notability. It's clear that abnormality or not, it's tough trying to fit in and belong in both worlds. School - High, low or middle - can feel like a religion or culture. Or worse, both. 
 I relive moments from this book and it makes me really appreciate the importance of true beauty and human goodness and those who are strong enough to attain it. True beauty is earned, we have to fight everyday to be beautiful inside and I cringe at how easy it is to be the opposite - ugly and cruel. That's one of the finest morals of this story. 
 My biggest problem with the story was the ending was too glassy, too blindly bright and shiny. Too squeaky clean - and dare I say it turned plastic. But(and this is a humongous BUT) like I said, I believe the true beauty of the story lies in the boy behind it - again even if some characters would have been more reader friendly if they had been a little more developed and more interesting in their narratives. All in all, this was a fairly good read.

August, a severely deformed student (in a society that so worships beauty) enters school for the first time, and faces some of the reactions one might expect under these circumstances. 
 The problems I had with the story were: 
 - The story is told by August, his sister Via, his friend Jack, and Via's boyfriend Justin, yet the characters' voices were all very similar. 
 - The characters were largely one-dimensional and this detracted from the emotional impact that more realistic portrayals could have achieved. 
 - August's parents were practically saints. 
 - The dialogue often did not ring true. 
 - Some happenings were too bizarre to be believable. For example, the school principal sends an email to parents of a child who has been assaulted, and in this message he launches into character praise of the responsible child. 
 - The ending tied everything up far too neatly. 
 The biggest problem I had with the story structure was the way conflicts were almost glossed over. There was far too little shown of what August (and even Jack) went through during periods of adversity and shunning. This was a significant missed opportunity. 
 In my opinion, a story that is meant to offer an honest depiction of life as a deformed child owes more to the reader than pat resolutions on all fronts, with the lone remaining bad guy neatly removed, and everyone else living happily ever after. 
 Despite all of that, I did enjoy much about ""Wonder"" and was entertained enough to read through to the end. Younger readers will undoubtedly find far less to fault in this story, and may well benefit from seeing the world through the experiences of someone like August. If it can help make young readers into kinder, more thoughtful people, then all of this book's shortcomings can be easily forgiven.","Thu Aug 02 06:59:58 -0700 2012","Sat Mar 29 08:21:05 -0700 2014","Thu Aug 02 08:03:58 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

 It was beautiful and wonderful for me to read about a disfigured child who goes to a mainstream middle school to approach the real world head on. It wasn't easy for August (Auggie for short), but I loved watching him win everyone over in the end. August has a genetic disorder that has left his mind sharp and intelligent, but as one character says ""the universe has not been kind"" to his face. 
 You get chapters from all the people in his life which I enjoyed including his sister, struggling with very real and related issues of her own, his new friend at school, one of his sister's friends, and his sister's boyfriend. Some know August really well and some barely at all giving the reader a very thorough view of August from the inside and outside. 
 His parents are amazing. They struggle with some of the challenges August faces, but they're amazing. Also, the principal of the school is an inspiring and warm character that I believe all principals should aspire to. 
 The book left me with an incredible feeling of hope in humankind.","Thu Mar 07 03:38:00 -0800 2013","Thu Mar 07 03:43:58 -0800 2013","Thu Mar 07 03:43:58 -0800 2013","",0,0,"False"

He had had, in his short life, many surgeries to try to correct and make his problems better, but they were still enough to startle people who weren't prepared for how he looked. Auggie lived at home with his Mom, Dad, and big sister Olivia, who was called Via by her family. His Mom had home schooled him up until now, and between them, his Mom and Dad decided it was the time for him to start school. So Auggie was to begin middle school as a new student, and he was terrified. He knew how people reacted to him, and he was prepared...but it still hurt and upset him, some times more than others. 
 When he went to his school prior to classes starting, to have a tour and meet some kids, he also met the Principal, Mr Tushman, who was very understanding. Mr Tushman had organised some other children to come in as well, to meet Auggie and show him around the school. Jack, Charlotte and Julian were noticeably uncomfortable with their role, but escorted Auggie around, and answered his questions, when he finally asked them! He was humiliated, and didn't want to be there... 
 Via was starting high school at the same time Auggie was starting middle school, but she had been left to her own devices for so long, as Auggie was the one who needed all the attention, that she managed everything pretty much on her own. 
 The story is broken up into chapters by the main characters all the way through, so we meet and hear their points of view. It is a heart-breaking but at the same time, heart-warming story of love, honesty, beauty and an incredible depth that can be found within certain people in overcoming adversity. 
 I highly recommend everyone read this remarkable book as it's one of those books that you will think about long after the last page is turned.","Tue Dec 18 02:45:58 -0800 2012","Fri Jan 18 20:23:13 -0800 2013","Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 -0800 2013",7,2,"False"

I got an autograph signed copy, and it has the extra Julian novella at the end. I finally decided to read it because my own book about special needs and bullying, No One Needed to Know, is on several lists with it and has been compared to it a few times. Well, all I can say is that I'm honored that anyone has ever made that comparison. Wonder is a brilliant middle grade novel. Telling Auggie's story from 6 different points of view makes the world he's living in vibrant and real. It was like I was walking the school hallways with him. Auggie is a smart, brave little boy with a cranio-facial abnormality that scares some kids so much that the only way they can handle it is to bully him. Thankfully, a couple outstanding children see past his looks and become true friends. He also has an amazing sister with an equally cool best friend and open-minded boyfriend. The addition of the Julian chapter at the end cinched the book for me. I'm sorry for people who read the book without it. He is the bully of the story, and this section of the book gives quite an insight to people who don't understand why they are the 'bad guys'. The way he finally learns to feel remorse for his actions brought tears to my eyes. The only thing negative I could say is that having dealt with bullies as a child and as a parent, kids aren't as easily won over as they are in the book.

 4. This extraordinary story deals with physical differences. Before reading the story, I would have a discussion with my students about differences all people have mentally and physically ranging from things as simple as being outgoing and having glasses to having depression or autism or being paralyzed. It would be important to communicate to my students that people who have more extreme or noticeable differences are really no different in character. Everyone wants to be loved. While reading the book in class, students would break into groups to discuss Auggie's difficulties throughout the book internally and externally. They could also talk about their own personal difficulties with difference or those of close associates and/or friends. At the end of the unit, we could watch a film that shows a person with a physical or mental disability overcoming their obstacles and demonstrating how they have the same amount of self worth as someone without a disability.","Sat Sep 21 12:27:28 -0700 2013","Tue Jun 14 10:41:24 -0700 2016","","",0,0,""

 There were two inconsistencies that I noticed and it slightly bothered me. 
 1. At one point, either in the blurb or in the beginning of the story, the author says that Auggie's deformity was not caused by his surgeries. In another instance, his surgeries caused his deformity. Which is it? 
 2. Auggie was talking to his mom or someone about Summer and how he only had lunch with her; no classes. Later on, it is stated that Auggie had English with Summer and lunch. Which is it? 
 These aren't really major issues and I could have misread things. 
 But overall, this was a great story with wonderful characters.","Thu Jan 05 17:05:17 -0800 2017","Sat Jul 08 13:10:38 -0700 2017","Sat Jul 08 13:47:43 -0700 2017","Fri Jul 07 21:52:43 -0700 2017",4,0,""

 This book is written for the Young Adult market but is certainly highly readable for adults as well. It is a story of hardships, played out by some hugely likeable characters. Happy in places and sad in others. I laughed, I cried and didn't want the book to end. 
 Auggie was born with extensive facial deformities caused by genetic aberrations. He is fortunate in being born into a loving stable family with an older sister, Via, who loves him dearly. His younger years were spent in and out of hospital with operations to make him more 'normal'. He was home schooled. When we meet him he is 10 years old, the operations are far less frequent and his parents are struggling with the idea that school would be good for him. Unfortunately his appearance is still shocking and his adjustment into school is traumatic but we are cheering him on every step of the way. 
 There is a strong moral content to this book but it is not preachy. The narrative is written from several points of view, but mainly Auggie and his sister. I couldn't put it down - this is certainly an author that I hope to read again in the future.","Wed Feb 29 11:24:48 -0800 2012","Thu Apr 05 16:00:57 -0700 2012","Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Wed Feb 29 00:00:00 -0800 2012",2,0,""

 You know that feeling you get so involved in the world of a book that the real world seems strange? Well, I guarantee that's how you'll feel after reading Wonder by RJ Palacio. 
 It is a heart-warming, heart-breaking story that it poignant and beautiful. It's a story about the importance of kindness and strength and courage. It's about doing good to other people and accepting others no matter what. There are many good people in this world and they definitely outnumber the bad. That's always been my saying and this book proves it. The amount of love that Auggie gets is astounding and you get definitely feel it - not just from his family but also from the friends he meets at Beecher Prep and the staff there.

 This book was amazing! I was immediately sucked in and could not put the book down! In fact, I brought it to a hockey game last night and read it in between periods. I was that hooked!

And, now that I am finished I still think so. How DO you get past the initial shock of someone who has a physical deformity? What IS the kindest way to react? How can you look past the outward appearance and get to know the person? 
 I once taught a girl who had severe cerebral palsy and I never managed to answer these questions. In her case, I never even managed to figure out how to communicate with her, but that really doesn't explain (or justify) my reactions to her. 
 There were parts of this book that were just a tad too good (Auggie's family), but most of the book was spot on for each of the different characters. The craft of the author really shows through in the shifts of points of view - with each character adding to the depth of the story. In literature for students of this age (somewhat young for YA; too old for middle grades), there is sometimes the temptation to simplify people and situations, but here the author purposely adds to the complexity, illustrating convincingly that you need to know each character better, before you really understand the situation.

At 10 years old, August (Auggie) Pullman was treated as though and acted as though he were an overgrown baby. After his parents argue and then finally agree that it is time for Auggie to grow up some, to have other relationships, other experiences, the parents enroll Auggie in a prep school (in preparation for university). The main administrator selects some other students to introduce themselves personally and to introduce Auggie to the physical layout of the school. Bravery and Kindness are the underlying themes to this novel. 
 Maybe because the book is written for the young adult age group, the Pullman parents are perfect parents and the Pullman children are lovely and well loved. Or maybe because the repeated theme of kindness is approached and re-approached and approached again.

He was born with a deformed face, and for reasons vaguely wiped away as ""parental overprotectiveness"" he's never attended school. During the course of the novel August treads an uplifting but entirely predictable story arc. From outcast with no friends, August eventually wins the hearts and minds of the entire school by being kind, smart, and brave. 
 It's a great lesson for kids, of course, to look beyond appearances to the soul within. But the circumstances of the novel are more troubling for adults who can see through the veneer of the classic feel-good tale. There's a lot of class-based virtue signalling at work in this book: August's family is wealthy enough to have a nice home in/near New York City, to send August to a private school, and to pay for a series of elaborate reconstructive surgeries. As in, money can't buy you happiness, but it sure can make you less unhappy. 
 Also, August is a bit of a Mary Sue: He never really does anything bad, is a smart, attentive student, a good friend, and brave soul. He likes Star Wars and his dog and family, and eventually grows to accept his role as sainted member of his middle school. 
 I'm not going to fault the author too much for her decisions, though, because ultimately the book succeeds at what it sets out to do. It just feels like it left a lot of interesting ideas unexplored in favor of a neatly wrapped bow of upper middle-class self-congratulation, and became a standing ovation to itself.","Sat Sep 23 13:27:00 -0700 2017","Mon Oct 02 23:02:02 -0700 2017","Sun Sep 24 12:42:16 -0700 2017","Sat Sep 23 13:27:01 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 Here's a book you just have to like for its feel-good story and important message. Fifth-grader Auggie Pullman has been born with a severe facial deformity, one that has required many surgeries. Previously home-schooled, his family enrolls him in a private middle-school in New York City, and that's where the story begins. 
 Not many people can say how a child like Auggie feels to be so disfigured, to be stared at, made fun of, and worse. He has felt it all, yet he remains remarkably upbeat, even when he's sad. Palacio does a nice job presenting Auggie's character, through his own words. She continues the story through other characters' narrations, giving us a wider perspective. Most interesting of these points of view is that of his older sister, Olivia, who has always loved and protected her brother, but begins to push away from that role. She is someone who has lived in the background at home, with necessary attention being given to her brother. 
 There are some stereotypical characters meant to underscore the author's message. Julian the bully, Summer, the good-hearted friend, and Jack Will, whose character is the most developed of August's friends. Jack is an on-the-fence kind of friend who is forced to choose between the popular kids and Auggie. 
 This is not a complicated story. The characters are simple, the plot somewhat predictable and the ending is neatly tied. I think it's important to try to read this from a fifth-grade point of view because that is the intended reader. I don't think it is meant to be completely realistic because its overall message of kindness would be lost to the reader if presented in the messier world of middle school, high school and parent dynamics. 
 I was a little disappointed, however, that Olivia's story was not developed more. I think there's the potential to write a great deal about the sibling who has to grow up with less attention. In addition, I read a review on Amazon that suggested Julian's point of view would have been interesting to read. I agree with that, but maybe the author thought it would make the book too negative. 
 Someone else commented that there are two kinds of children's books: the kind that are meant to entertain and the kind that send a moral message. 
 If you're not sure which one Wonder is, Mr. Tushman, the school principal, caps the story with this: Quoting J. M. Barrie in The Little White Bird, he tells the children, ""Shall we make a new rule of life...always try to be a little kinder than is necessary?"" 
 Personally, I like messier, complicated stories, but I'm not a kid anymore...","Fri Sep 20 03:41:25 -0700 2013","Sun Sep 22 16:20:44 -0700 2013","","",0,0,""

 I read Wonder aloud to my family, which includes my hubby, a teen son, and a tween daughter. Averaging our ratings, we came up with 4.5 stars. As I read, I often had to pause, as each point of view resonated with me in some fashion, especially Via. I grew up with a sister who has cerebral palsy, and was confronted with many of the same things as Via was. 
 My tween daughter read this first and brought it to me, asking if it could be our next family read-aloud.

The changing narrative voice was appreciated, as I sometimes grew tired of one perspective, but then the perspective changed, adding freshness and interest. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the final section, told in the voice of the antagonist bully, as it seemed inauthentic, whiney, and forced. It was as if readers had asked for this section to let us have at least a bit of empathy for him, but the author couldn't even figure out why he was such a jerk. This took away from the whole book for me. 
 On the positive side, it was nice to read a story about a ""different"" person that you might see on the street, trying not to stare. This tension of trying to be normal and respectful was the most successful part of this book. Understanding from the perspective of family, new friends, old friends, bystanders and the protagonist himself... This acknowledgement of a challenging social situation was handled sincerely and artfully by the author. 
 Turning the protagonist into a hero and changing all of the hearts and minds except for the most intractable (and inauthentic-- see my bully comments above) seemed somewhat forced. If the author had stopped somewhat short of total acceptance and celebration from an entire middle school, and, instead, developed a more intimate understanding among a smaller group would have been more impactful to me.","Tue Jun 10 05:40:46 -0700 2014","Tue Dec 16 06:19:08 -0800 2014","Mon Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Tue Nov 25 00:00:00 -0800 2014",1,2,""

For most kids this might be a little intimidating, but mostly exciting. For Auggie, though, the thought is mostly scary. Entering a new place where everyone will be looking at him, whispering behind their hands, maybe even laughing at him. This is because Auggie isn't like most other kids. He was born with a severe facial deformity that always gets a reaction no matter where he goes. Auggie decides to give school a chance and has a year of ups and downs while he deals with the trials and tribulations of middle school as a kid who is different then everybody else. 
 An important book about the value of kindness and tolerance that is being read pretty heavily in the community I work in. The book skirts preachiness by viewing Auggie's story through many points of view. Seeing how other characters feel about Auggie and how he affects their life kicks it up a notch above other stories with similar themes. Several well developed characters grow throughout the book, Auggie most notably, but also his friend Jack and even some peripheral characters as well. Dialog sometimes seemed more like a transcript then a novel - distracted parents talking about one thing while someone else talked about something else - probably wouldn't bother most people, but it irked me for some reason.","Sun Dec 23 05:36:59 -0800 2012","Sun Dec 23 05:51:03 -0800 2012","Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",0,0,"False"

 1) The main character is not perfect or saintly. 
 2) The other characters respond to him in a wide range of ways, with lots of nuance. And the negative responses have an explanation - not an excuse, but a backstory that helps them make sense. The mean kids are not just mean because they're evil (most of them). 
 3) Middle school is the perfect setting for this, because there's so much general meanness and weirdness going on anyway. 
 4) Lots of different first person narratives, lots of points of view, again, great insight into the complicated machinations of adolescent relationships. I'm kinda sad we didn't get Julian's because it would've been interesting if a little disturbing. Maybe that would've been too dark. 
 And of course, very thought-provoking and useful for exploring the issue of facial anomalies and how much we humans react to appearance.

So far all the books I have from that genre have been really good and I loved or really liked them. And this one is no exception. Wonder was such a fantastic read. 
 The characters who were nice to Auggie just made me so happy for him, and the characters who weren't I just want to push off a cliff basically. With Via and how her life is like in her first year of high school felt so relate-able to me, and the choices she made. I just felt like this story was just really good and for the most part realistic. The one part I didn't find realistic was at the end where Auggie gets the award, and every one is cheering for him. I kind of expected that some of the parents at least would not be cheering (and Auggie would notice), or something like that. But they all cheered for him. I personally don't find that realistic. But I am somewhat letting this slide since it's a middle grade book. 
 Overall, this was just an amazing, amazing read. 4.5/5 stars, and I really really want to read more from R.J. Palacio since I really loved Wonder.","Thu Nov 28 18:24:23 -0800 2013","Fri Apr 18 19:11:27 -0700 2014","Thu Feb 27 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sat Feb 22 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0,"True"

 Book for middle grade readers about tolerance and acceptance. Auggie Pullman is born with crano-facial abnormalities. After years of surgeries that make home schooling more practical than traditional school, Auggie begins 5th grade at a private prep school in Manhattan. The book traces Auggie's fifth grade year: making friends, dealing with bullying, field trips, and the death of the family dog. 
 While mainly narrated in the first person by Auggie, the book does shift perspectives to include sections narrated by his sister, Olivia, her boyfriend, Justin, her former best friend Miranda, and two of Auggie's new friends, Jack and Summer. This technique allows the reader to see others perspectives of Auggie but I didn't find it all that necessary. Auggie is an appealing narrator and fairly perceptive about the world around him. 
 For some reason I kept expecting Auggie to die in a tragic manner (he does not); instead the kids graduate from 5th grade (do they really have elaborate 5th grade commencement ceremonies these days?) and many of Auggie's classmates have been changed for the better by getting to know him. 
 I liked the book but did not find it as touching and moving as many people have. Kids especially seem to like the book which is ideal for using in a school curriculum about tolerance and kindness.","Fri Sep 27 08:58:09 -0700 2013","Wed Oct 02 13:41:55 -0700 2013","Wed Oct 02 13:41:55 -0700 2013","Fri Sep 27 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,"False"

While it's not the most amazing book I've ever read, it's an excellent book with a great message for both kids and adults alike - don't judge a book (or human) by it's cover. 
 August (Auggie) was born with a very unfortunate and rare mix of genes that left his face severely misshapen and disfigured. Until 5th grade, he is schooled at home by his mother, who he is very close to. However, as 5th grade approaches, his parents feel it might be a good idea for him to go to a real school. August hates the idea at first, but is soon talked into it, especially after he tours the school and sees the possibilities. 
 August has to go through a lot of trials while at school because of the way he looks - genuine horror from people who've never seen him before, taunting from other children, a game called the ""plague"" where if anyone accidentally touches him, they have 10 seconds to wash his germs off of them. Through it all, August reacts in turns like the child he is but also the more mature child he's been forced to become due to his disfigurement. With the help of some kind children who befriend him, August blooms and overcomes, eventually winning over essentially his entire school. 
 I very much enjoyed this book and especially the fact that the author broke the story into narrations from several of the key characters - August; his sister, Via; his friends, Summer and Jack; Via's boyfriend, Justin - etc. It's helpful in ways like initially, August refuses to describe himself, saying only whatever we, the reader, are thinking, it's much worse. But when Via narrates, we get a description. Also it's helpful to understand the emotions and feelings of all of the characters involved in the story - for instance Via, who can't remember what life was like before August. While she loves her brother and understands the circumstances, she can't help but envy the fact that he gets more attention from their parents. And she can't help the guilt that, as she starts a new school, she doesn't want to be known as the girl with the deformed little brother. 
 I think the book is an excellent read for pre-teens through adults. Hopefully, it will help us all look and react a little more kindly to those less fortunate than ourselves.","Thu Sep 27 18:42:06 -0700 2012","Mon Oct 01 11:45:38 -0700 2012","Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,0,""

 10 year old Augie Pullman, born with a terrible facial abnormality, won't describe what he looks like but says, ""Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" Previously homeschooled, this narrative is about his being mainstreamed into 5th grade at a middle school. It is described in short chapters by 6 different narrators: his older sister, 2 of her friends, 2 of his classmates, & himself. 
 Palacio, the author, does a skillful job giving each of the narrators a very honest and distinctive voice. They all sound sincere & real. It makes you feel like you really are taking this journey right alongside Auggie as you are given a glimpse into all their lives. The characters are complicated. No one, not even Auggie, is all good or all bad. The situations are realistic, from the bullying in the halls of Beecher Prep to the small family dramas in the Pullman home. 
 The multiple perspectives also allow the reader to know more than any one character does, even (especially) Auggie. As Mr. Tushman, the school principal, points out, ""there are almost always more than two sides to every story."" 
 This is an awesome book about a kid who is truly a Wonder. At times heartbreaking & at times triumphant, it is a story of how one person can make a difference. Despite the expected sadness in Wonder, there is also much humor, joy and hope. Kids and adults alike will love this stellar debut by a first time author. If you haven't read it yet, I think you should - it's worth all five stars and even more.

 I enjoyed it - it was bittersweet and a bit wrenching, but overall pretty good. 
 I didn't expect the multiple perspectives - I thought the book would follow Auggie all the way through. I ultimately liked that the portrait of Auggie was fleshed in by those around him. 
 There's a bit of Owen Meany going on here in the character, with a bit of ""Heft"" in the vulnerability and ache of trying to find acceptance (both from himself and others). 
 I enjoyed it and feel it's a great pick for Battle of the Books and an excellent read for kids approaching middle school. 
 I'm so glad I didn't read this in June after putting my dog to sleep. The scene with Daisy squashed my heart and got me ridiculously choked up. 
 Loved the Principal. 
 Thought it interesting that it touched on the theme of inclusion in the sense of ""ownership."" Someone who is an underdog in one circle and not treated as a member of that group can suddenly become the person most protected and ""owned"" by that group when threatened by an outsider. In this way, the fight in the woods/cornfield felt like a believable turn of events. I've seen similar situations play out often in other contexts - online communities, work circles, real communities... 
 It may be something to think about (getting kids to take ownership and step into a protective role vs. competitive) in terms of bullying and strategies to help stop it.","Sun Sep 07 22:26:28 -0700 2014","Sun Nov 29 12:22:52 -0800 2015","","",1,0,"True"

Told from multiple viewpoints, it's the story of August, a student entering the fifth grade. Auggie's previously been homeschooled due to a host of medical issues related to a severe facial abnormality. So it's the trauma of being brand new to school, added to the challenge of being remarkably physically different than his classmates. 
 The general plot is pretty much the one you expect from the premise of the book -- he has trials and tribulations, and the other kids have various reactions that he has to navigate. But overall, this is just QUALITY writing for middle readers (it's not YA). Almost all of the different voices add something to the story, and the characters and their situations are reasonably complex and the emotions feel very real, even given the somewhat boilerplate nature of the story arc. 
 A small mention that it's set in New York City, and it feels very believable and supports the plot nicely - but doesn't, I think, make things so New York-centric that other readers will be put off. It reminded me a little of When You Reach Me in this respect (although it's not at all similar to that book in terms of theme).","Mon Apr 09 09:55:42 -0700 2012","Mon Apr 30 08:59:38 -0700 2012","Sun Apr 29 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",1,0,"False"

 So Wonder is about Auggie ( who has facial deformity) who is starting 5th grade. He was homeschooled and had never studied in a mainstream school. Wonder follows Auggie's journey through 5th grade. 
 What blew me away was how well all the characters' POV chapters worked together. There are multiple POVs. So many POVs. It's a recipe for disaster. It's not supposed to work! But it does! 
 We have chapters from Auggie, his sister Olivia, his friends Summer and Jack, and even from Olivia's boyfriend Justin! All in a 300 pages book! It's astonishing. It never felt too stuffed or forced. I was never annoyed by the change in POV in each part. Each character had a unique voice. They all had beautiful character arcs ( especially Jack and Olivia. I love them so much). 
 We even have a Julian chapter. It was like an addition, after the story had ended ( I've seen it being listed on Goodreads as a novella. My edition had it in the book itself). To be honest, I wasn't going to read it. I loved how the book had ended and I kind of despised Julian(he was on of Auggie's main bullies). But I'm so glad I didn't. It was so wonderful! So don't skip that chapter ( it's not exactly a chapter. Sort of a part, like 100 pages long).

 August Pullman was born with a facial deformity. He has been homeschooled his entire life due to his health. Finally Auggie has the opportunity to attend public school for fifth grade. Wonder is the story of his fifth grade year, told from the points-of-view of August, her sister Via, Via's boyfriend Justin, her best friend Miranda, as well as Auggie's friend Jack. 
 Why I picked up the book: It has been recommended to me numerous times by a variety of people. 
 Why I finished it: I could not put the book down, even the second time! I especially loved Auggie's parents. I would hope to be that great of a parent in that type of situation. 
 I'd give it to: Absolutely anyone. It has a great message about kindness, love, and acceptance that we all (teens, adults, parents, teachers, students) need to hear and be reminded of on a frequent basis.

I buddy read Wonder with my son and he wanted to DNF. It was required summer reading so no such luck for him. Our favorite parts were the precepts at the end. I'm fully aware that our experience is in a crazy minority for this title but that's how it goes sometimes. Neither one of us felt engaged or connected with the characters at any time in this story. We tried though. We took a lot of breaks, discussed the book as it progressed, brainstormed precepts of our own...it just wasn't happening. We wanted this book to be over. Regardless, I would still recommend Wonder to others, because like I said, our experience appears to be rare and the morals of this story are invaluable for every age. You're never too old to practice kindness or to re-evaluate how success is really measured. This book may have sucked for us but the life lessons made it worth it. Two stars instead of one :) 
 Note: The audio narration for Auggie's voice is awful in our opinion. Just because a person may have facial abnormalities does not mean their voice will be equally impaired. I found the narration insulting to Auggie's character and frankly it was grating to listen to based on my personal reading experience. It's hard to say if we would have enjoyed Wonder a bit more if we read it off the page instead. I thought this element was worth noting.

 Unit ideas: 
 --Fiction/Non-Fiction Pairing: Wonder would make a great bookend to Lucy Grealy's ""Autobiography of a Face"" 
 -- Differences: Wonder might fit in well in a diversity unit when we end up asking questions about differences that are ""skin-deep"" 
 -- Possible literature pairing with Frankenstein, with a focus on deformities and ""monsters"" 
 -- Point of view: book is told from multiple perspectives 
 What I love most about Wonder is its portrayal of adults and elders as imperfect but ultimately redeemable human beings. There are moral villains in this book, yes, and I appreciate how Palacio doesn't give them a change to reform -- that would be too unrealistic-- but does handle them in a somewhat ""happily ever after"" kind of way. That is to say, this book is ultimately optimistic but we know that there are real challenges ahead for our hero, and that no matter how many friends our hero will gain the world will still sometimes be a cruel place without reason.

 I'm still processing the story in my head. I'm still amazed. 
 This was the kind of book that only after 20 pages I started crying like a baby. There were many moments while I was reading that I started crying like a baby (the Daisy chapters, particularly). 
 The end of the story, though... The standing ovation... I'm still speechless. Speechless out of love for this character that never gave up, never stopped being funny, kind, friendly. And this character, this August that I fell in love with, was so well-written and so brilliantly good throughout the entire story. 
 This is the kind of book that make you remember how you should be good. How you should be kinder than necessary, like Ms. Tushman said. And I thought it'd get a bit boring like ""Room"" did, because it was written through the perspective of a 10 year old, but I was really into the whole thing and just couldn't stop reading.

Yes Wonder is one of *those* books. 
 What I love about Wonder is how simple it is. This is a book about a ten-year-old boy whose face is deformed. And that's it. There's no huge complex plot, no far away land, magic, or fantasy creatures. This book doesn't need any of that stuff to hook the reader, August's voice is enough. 
 Auggie believes that he is just an ordinary ten-year-old kid but that's the one thing I'd have to disagree with him on. But Auggie's face isn't what makes him different it's his huge, brave, heart and big personality. Auggie is the kind of character who touches your heart and who you fiercely want to protect and want the best for. He's such a special little guy who I think we could all learn a thing or two from. 
 Wonder is full of fleshed out and vibrant characters and although the majority of the book is told from August's perspective the book is also told from several other characters point of view. Each protagonist has a unique outlook on Auggie and tells their story and how having August in their life has affected them in both good and bad ways. Before reading this book I'd never given much thought on what it would be like to know someone like August and the bullying a friend might go through for hanging out with him, or how a sibling might constantly come second to a little brother who has much greater needs than a normal child. This book is a real eye opener not only to what it might be like to be in Auggie's shoes but also for what it's like for those who know and love him. 
 R.J Palacio is such a talented writer. Not only has she created such warm and likeable characters but she writes with such honesty as well. Whilst this book is definitely sad in parts Auggie is such an inspiring, happy go lucky, funny kid and at times he's simply a ten-year-old boy observing the world around him. Yes this book made me cry but it also made me laugh out loud too. 
 Wonder is a book for everybody young or old. It's an important and special book to be shared and discussed by both adults and children. This book makes you want to be a kinder person and I can't help but feel that if everyone were to read it the world would be a nicer place. This is one of the best books I've read all year and I would whole heartedly recommend it to absolutely anybody.","Fri Nov 04 03:59:49 -0700 2011","Thu Nov 17 08:35:55 -0800 2011","Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 -0700 2011","",6,3,""

Also August (Auggie) though he has plenty going against him he has such a positive view point. He may not look like everyone else, but he's nice, smart, and pretty much a little dork. 
 This is told not only in August POV but others around him. At first I didn't know how to feel about that, but understand why it was important. It was to see the point of views of those around August. 
 It was also told by different voices (thanks to audible) which was a fun time to hear them with the other characters. 
 LOVED: 
 Like I said the realistic elements in these book. Like how August reacted to another school. Or the way people react to him, along with the bullying. Sure August had his ups and downs which is expected however he grew up to the challenge which was wonderful. 
 The friendships (mostly Jack and Summer) are the best. Yes they started off as his not so sure of him to being his best friends. August grew a friend base slowly with the other students with his humor and charm. That ending shows how much August touched the other kids at Beecher Prep School. Well except one but that's not to bad in the whole picture. 
 The grownups where written very well in how they treat August. His parents are like the most supportive and fun parents. The Pullmans have there inside jokes and such a close bound. Then we have the grownups that August school who didn't treat August differently which was nice. Also they didn't let bullying happen. There was also those who weren't so nice however it was good to see the other side of it. 
 Audible Version 
 I liked the different voices and thought they did really good for making the characters have different voices. I will say though August voice wasn't my favorite. Other than that this was a really good book to listen to. Now though I want to own and read it in physical format. 
 The only thing that I didn't like is that these is the only book. There are also novellas of some of the side characters. I still would love to continue with all these characters.","Mon Sep 12 19:20:48 -0700 2016","Sat Sep 23 17:25:15 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 -0700 2016",2,1,"False"

 It has really helped me, and whenever I feel sorry for myself, I would always remind myself of August and his unfortunate predicament, and how so many people in the world have it so much harder than I do, and feel as though I have much lighter boots on. 
 I also loved the Hobbit and Star Wars references in here, being a hard-core fan of both. 
 I can't even imagine how I would be able to face the world as boldly as August does, I would probably use my hair to cover my face as much as I could, or be like August and use a cool astronaut mask. 
 I thought that August's sister's problems were extremely relatable, as my own younger brother has ADHD and dyslexia (he may be a demigod, who knows?), and he's the only one in our family who has learning difficulties. He gets bullied a lot and I stick up for him as much as I possibly can, but it does nothing to deter the name-calling.

 Normally, I do not take the time to re-read books unless I absolutely love them. With three reads, I obviously love this one! 
 The major theme of acceptance is something, I believe, relates to not only children, but to everyone. How many times have we judged someone due to their outward appearance? It isn't right, but it's reality. In this chapter book, the author cleverly pulls in a variety of children (middle school and high school) to give their version of the interactions and reactions toward the central character, August, and his facial deformity.

Wonder is about a young boy, August, who was born with a face deformity and is about to start fifth grade in a private school after being home-schooled his whole life. R.J. Palacio did a great job depicting the different young characters' points of view and in a way that one can relate with all of them. I don't usually read YA books, but found this one as part of a list of books being made into movies in 2017. I am a second grade teacher, so reading the plot is what initially attracted me to this book. I am so glad I found this book and I cannot wait to watch the movie. I would definitely recommend this book to young readers and adults. It has a great lesson of acceptance and kindness. These were my favorite quotes: 
 ""The things we do outlast our mortality. The things we do are like monuments that people build to honor heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids that the Egyptians built to honor the pharaohs. Only instead of being made of stone, they're made out of the memories people have of you."" 
 ""The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success."" 
 """"It's like people you see sometimes, and you can't imagine what it would be like to be that person, whether it's somebody in a wheelchair or somebody who can't talk. Only, I know that I'm that person to other people, maybe to every single person in that whole auditorium. To me, though, I'm just me.

 Although I'm not 100% sure all the points of view were really needed, I did feel that it worked most of the time, allowing us to see Auggie's story from the points of view of those he came into contact with, so we could understand not only how Auggie was feeling and why, but also why others acted the way they did around him, and what it was about their own stories that made them that way. 
 It added an extra depth to the story that I don't think could have been gained from telling it purely from Auggie's point of view. 
 The characters were all really fantastic, and there are some really beautiful moments in the book - some made me laugh, some made me cry so fiercely I thought I'd have no tears left to give (both sad and happy tears!). 
 This was an incredibly moving story about friendship, equality, understanding, kindness, forgiveness, and so many other wonderful things. It gave me goosebumps.

Based on personal experience, I think that middle school is especially hard for almost all children but even more so for the child who is perceived by others as being ""different"". Auggie Pullman has been homeschooled all his life; in part because he's had so many different kinds of surgeries and in part, because his parents wish to protect him from the unkindness of strangers. Finally, his parents relent and allow him to start fifth grade at Beecher Prep. He is bullied, shunned, teased and ignored but Auggie does win a couple of friends. In the course of the story, we hear from his sister, Via, and his friends both old and new about what it is like to orbit planet Auggie. The climax of the book comes when Auggie and his friend, Jack, are set upon by some seventh graders from another school while on an outing. In the nick of time, three boys who had not had any use for Auggie before show up and chase the seventh grade ruffians away. This cements their relationship with Auggie who is now seen in a new light by all. In addition to being more widely accepted, Auggie wins a special award at fifth grade graduation for his bravery in just going to school for the first time and for bringing out the best in his fellow students. All I can say is that while this is a wonderful message of hope for children who are ""different"" in their appearance, it shouldn't be generalized to offer hope to all children who are ""different"" in behavior or intellect.","Wed Jul 13 13:05:13 -0700 2016","Wed Jul 13 13:15:42 -0700 2016","Wed Jul 13 13:15:42 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 -0700 2016",1,2,""

 This book is about August, or Auggie, who was born with facial deformity and after years of homeschooling due to his multiple surgeries, he's finally going to be starting fifth grade in a public school. It's a story about a boy trying to live a normal life despite what he might look like. 
 I really liked the plot of this book. And I liked the fact that it was a middle grade novel because I love middle grade. 
 This book has a great premise and a great story to tell. The book is well written and well paced. I even like the multiple perspectives. It was nice to know what others thought of Auggie and how they dealt with it. I wish we'd gotten the perspective of Auggie's parents though that's okay. 
 My favourite part was the one with Via's POV. I really liked her character as well. 
 I do have a few problems with the book, though. 
 One problem is the narrative. The reason I love middle grade is largely because the characters are just kids. I love getting the perspective of someone who has yet to get to the angsty, lying stage of their life. I love the innocence and the simplicity. But the narrative here didn't sound like that of a 10-year-old at all. Auggie didn't feel 10. 
 Another problem was the format for Justin's part. It was with minimal punctuation and no caps. I might have been okay with it if there had been a reason given for the format, but there wasn't. 
 The story became a bit dull and cheesy near the end. Predictable too. I wasn't as interested at that point. 
 Finally, there was the message about being kind. Kindness is great and all but other things are important too. The message worked for this book but not otherwise. I didn't agree with it entirely. 
 Overall, this was a good book but it didn't resonate with me, emotionally.","Sat Jun 18 10:53:35 -0700 2016","Sun Jan 01 00:38:08 -0800 2017","Wed Jun 22 08:16:11 -0700 2016","Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 -0700 2016",2,0,"False"

 The book moves quickly, building in power and sentiment. You will be charmed by 'Auggie' and learn the paradox that probably every 'different' person feels: Different. But 'normal' on the inside. 
 A character quotes from a book by JM Barrie: ""...always try to be a little kinder than necessary."" It's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed. 
 Such a simple but powerful concept. The book brought tears to my eyes. Because of the kindness part, not the cruelty. I'm reminded that we are all so powerful. A kind word...look or deed is within all of us.

 August Pullman has been home-schooled, partly because of extensive surgeries, doctor's appointments, and physical therapies he's needed due to the extreme facial deformity he was born with. And, let's face it, partly because kids can be cruel. But now the 5th grade is willing to try school, a middle school near his home. The principal hand-picks three kids to show Auggie around before school starts, but that doesn't mean that he is accepted right away. 
 I liked it. While most of the story is from the point of view of August, we do see things from some other characters, including his older sister. Parts are very, very heartwarming, parts make you really examine your own actions, and parts make you just want to do bad things to some characters. (Julian's parents, anyone?) One thing I really liked were all the references to great kids' books.

This novel is so heartbreaking, and so poignant that I wonder how much young adults will truly take from it, although I hope it is a lot. I cried so many times during this book, my heart really aches for this main character. I feel as though I really connected with August in light of my own personal journey and it felt some sort of cathartic to read the words of his pain, his fear of being labelled, and his bluntness about his differences in a voice other than my own. 
 I also found it so interesting that this novel was told not only from August's point of view, but also from those of those close to him. I found this a very effective way to examine not only the issues that come with being ""different"" but also those that come along with dealing with differences, choosing sides, and doing what is right over what is easy. At least for me, I had never really considered how profoundly my own differences could have impacted those around me. 
 Overall, I think this was an amazing book. And while I am cognizant of the fact that this is a novel for young adults, though I was happy at the end of the novel, I found the ending a bit unrealistic. While I would love to believe that the ending that happened is one that would realistically happen, I can't say that I found it really believable. The fact that those are the feelings I ended this book on, I actually felt really sad at the end, disappointed in my own jadedness and pessimism when it comes to humanity as a whole.","Sun Feb 23 16:26:58 -0800 2014","Fri Apr 11 15:23:40 -0700 2014","Thu Apr 10 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sun Apr 06 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 This book made me smile and made feel bad for our little Auggie. I really thank the author for writing so close to my feelings: I really felt what Auggie felt, so when he was happy, my chest was pounding about to explode. I wanted to be part of the group, of his friends; I wanted to go back in time when I was ten and laugh and cry like he did. 
 This is the best example of a children's book that can be read as an adult or as a teen. I devoured in almost one day, I almost cried in the end, I highlighted so many phrases...

 Despite these challenges, Auggie manages to survive school, thanks to some wonderful classmates and his devoted family. A unique aspect of this book is that it is told from the perspectives of multiple characters, allowing readers to better understand the characters' motivations and actions. 
 I couldn't put this book down and really enjoyed reading it!

 The book itself was beautifully written and constructed. 
 I personally know a little baby boy who was born with the same facial deformity that August has, and I know that I would never think of him differently.

 But I didn't give 5 stars. The writing seemed somehow off. I think my biggest issue with the novel was the shifting point-of-view. I felt that August's chapters felt the most authentic, especially since it's essentially his story. I liked Via's as well, and Summer's didn't bother me, but, once we got to Jack's, I wasn't feeling it anymore. I felt disconnected from August, in a sense. Justin's chapters threw me off too -- the shift from regular punctuation and capitalization to a lack thereof seemed awkward and forced. Overall, I feel like the novel could have worked better had it been told entirely from August's POV, or possibly in the 3rd person. I think multiple points-of-view can work really well, but I don't think it did for Wonder, which felt very jumbled and incohesive at times.","Fri Apr 04 14:17:25 -0700 2014","Thu Aug 14 19:43:18 -0700 2014","Tue May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Fri May 09 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"False"

While we all may ""judge a book by its cover"" -- even if it's just for a moment -- we all want to be liked for who we are, not what we look like. It's not okay to bully, it's not okay to make fun of someone for being different. And how much more enriching can our life be if we let people's personality shine? 
 It's interesting that I finished this book around the same time that the news story about the KFC employee and the little girl that had been mauled by dogs came out. This toddler girl has lost an eye and has multiple scars on her face because of the attach, and some insensitive person had the gall to say something about it. When I actually looked at the little girl, my heart went out to her, and I thought, ""Poor baby girl."" Yes, there was a moment of pity. Pity that she had to endure this. Pity that I'm sure she has suffered a lot (both physically and emotionally). And, I would have perhaps blinked a moment, and then shown her kindness (like this book espouses). 
 Some people may think that being kind to someone with a ""deformity"" or ""handicap"" is being condescending, and perhaps some people are/can be, because they don't know what else to do. I'd rather someone be shown a slightly feigned kindness for a moment than outright ruddiness or disgust. Yes, we can respect people on a basic human level, but even that seems hard for people. 
 There were a few little things about this book that did take me back a little. There are different voices used for narration, so that was interesting. And ... it did seem a little too neat and tidy toward the end. I did tear up a little for the things being said.

And a good reminder to everyone that we all have our own trials, each one of us, no matter how things look from the outside. It was neat to see each individual perspective about how life is hard. 
 A few quotes from the book I liked: 
 ""The universe takes care of all it's birds."" 
 (-p.204 Justin in response to Miranda's comment: the universe was not kind to Auggie Pullman) 
 ""Funny how sometimes you worry a lot about something and it turns out to be nothing."" 
 (-p.215 Auggie about his hearing aids) 
 ""You don't need your eyes to love, right? You just feel it inside you."" 
 (-p.227 Auggie's mom about people in heaven) 
 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 (-p.231 about Via's play...and it was obvious at that moment that Auggie would end up with his own standing ovation) 
 ""I was going to be extraordinary, but there would be no one there to see."" 
 (-p.243 Miranda making a sacrifice for her friend) 
 ""It's so weird how...you could have a night that's the worst in your life, but to everybody else it's just an ordinary night."" 
 (-p.273 Auggie reflecting on the normalcy of everything just after he'd gotten beaten up) 
 ""The sky was the same. The movie was the same. Everyone's faces were the same...but something was different. Something had changed."" 
 (-p.274 Auggie realizing the world was going to be different...the ""big turning point"") 
 These were all great lessons and things to remember. 
 With all that warm fuzziness said, here's why I didn't rate it higher: 
 The idea of this book was good, there were a few sweet moments and a few tears shed, and it'll probably be a great movie, but I kinda feel like it only got published because the author worked in the publishing industry and ""knew people"". 
 There is a great moral lesson for children, but it reads sort of like a ""travel log"" or ""interviews with the characters"". And I never really ""felt"" what August was going through, all the characters were sort of flat and removed. I was actually kind of bored and kept waiting for the good part that's making everyone rave about it and turn it into a movie. Honestly, I cried the most over the dog dying than anything else, and that had very little to do with the overall story other than it helped Auggie realize the world was bigger than just him. 
 Not a lot really happened in this book and the ""big turning point"" for the whole story was sort of unrealistic, almost seemed ""made up"" to give the story conflict. Seriously? I would never let my ""normal"" 5th grader go on a 3-day retreat out into the ""woods"" with a bunch of other 5th graders and no parents. I know that's just me being ""over protective"" but supposedly Auggie's parents were also ""over protective"" and they had sheltered him his entire life. Why would they suddenly send him off ""as a lamb to the slaughter""? I understand the whole analogy of ""a lamb to the slaughter"" when referring to sending him to a real school, but sending him on this retreat was way more literally ""a slaughter"" waiting to happen. 
 And, the ending was ""happy-fuzzy"" with the awards and such, and ""they all lived happily ever after"" but it was all sort of forced and predictable. I was happy Auggie won an award (yay for him, he got his standing ovation!) but realistically he didn't do anything to earn it. He was kind of whiny and self-pitying, and then he got beat up in the woods and suddenly he's this big hero? Jack and Amos are the ones who actually ""did"" something in that situation, they probably should have gotten that award. 
 And what ever happened to Justin? Was there really even a purpose for his character? 
 In summary I gave this 3 stars because it's a good message and I like the idea of it, but the execution of the idea is lacking. The kids were unrealistically mean and the conflict was too staged. The adults were too dumb and oblivious and the characters were all very flat. The voice of the 10 year olds didn't really sound believable to their supposed ages and other than everyone ""wondering"" what happened to his face I failed to see the ""wonder"" in August. He was just an uninteresting, unexceptional kid with a facial deformity.","Tue Sep 19 12:12:48 -0700 2017","Wed Sep 20 05:26:35 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

He has an obvious genetic injury, which only affects his face and hearing. While both adults and children are characters in this book, the most resonant, are the voices of the children. 
 There are chapters (called parts) from the viewpoints of Auggie's sister Olivia (""Via"") and other children whose lives intersect with Auggie's. This technique makes the flow of the book especially easy for even a young reader to develop empathy with the viewpoints presented. It is almost a surreptitious way to learn empathy. 
 The reader can take this as Auggie's coming-of-age story as a middle school student who is unfamiliar with school routine, but very familiar with self-knowledge, irony and human nature. Or on a deeper level, this story can be taken as a primer on how to be a human being. 
 Originally I felt that the author should have included a table of contents. After completing the book, I feel that the author's design worked. Auggie's world requires some immersion; the part titles and quotes are much more appreciated while traveling through Auggie's life in middle school. 
 In the Appendix, the author gives the reader a peek into the state of mind of various characters during the summer vacation following the grade 5 graduation ceremony. To avoid spoilers, I will not mention specifics, but I enjoyed the information. 
 Many parts of this story made me sad which does reflect life in general. However, this story is not just of the accomplishments of one ten-year-old boy, but also how others around him become more than what they once were.

 It's a gem of a story, about a little boy called August ""Auggie"" who has an genetic defect that has changed his face, himself and his family are perfectly aware of the attention he attracts and because of this, he was homeschooled, so when his parents decide to send him to an outside school in fifth grade....

The author switches perspectives (all are 1st person), but does it on a section to section basis, making it easier to transition. Most of the time you see the world through Auggie's eyes--he's been affected by improbable set of genetic and happenstance set of circumstances that affected the way his face developed. His is not a ""normal"" face and he's also had a lot of concomitant medical issues. This isolate him and he's come to expect that people will treat him differently--although obviously unfairly. 
 This is about a year in his life and in the lives of those around him, how each changes and grows--or doesn't, in one case. Throughout the book, you see that this is an exceptional young man with a superficial difference that the people around him learn to accept. 
 His family is very close, very supportive, but even they have to deal with the prejudice that others feel. The adults have long since learned to deal with it, but his sister is going through a troubling period of her own and she begins to see (as she says) with two sets of eyes--the eyes of a sister who loves her brother and doesn't notice the difference and the eyes of how others see him. For a freshman in high school this can be challenging, since she's trying to make a new life for herself as well.

 In short - it was fantastic. Read it. 
 To say a bit more - I'm a teacher and I hate bullying with a white hot passion. Bullying makes me angry more than anything else. Why? No one has the right to make someone else's life horrible and difficult and unhappy. No one has the right to target another person for no real reason. No one. I just can't fathom someone thinking it's ok to do! So this book hit home a lot. To watch Auggie go through what he did hurt my heart. Yes my heart was healed in the end, but it hurt to watch him have to cope with the cruel behavior of others. I'd love to be naive enough to think stuff like this doesn't happen. I so wish that was true. 
 I loved the way the story was told. To hear from multiple characters was amazing. It created this completely full and well rounded story. You came to understand what was happening with many characters, and you could understand more why they did what they did. It also helped you gain a stronger understanding about how bullying affects all people involved not just the person being bullied. It would not have been the story it was without constructing the book this way. 
 Really - if you haven't read this book you should. Yes it was hard for me to watch it all unfold, but the hope and optimism at the end was so much stronger and uplifting.","Thu Sep 13 07:52:17 -0700 2012","Thu Jan 01 16:36:36 -0800 2015","Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,0,""

 This book shows his experience for his first year in a public school- middle school (which is already tough!) and how he copes with other students, and learns how to deal with many difficult hardships. 
 From page one, I was drawn into this book. Now I have to admit my slight post-book depression.,I feel like the book went by WAY TOO FAST! It's just such a fantastic read, as you see how looks don't matter, it's what's inside that really matters!

 This book tells about August's fifth grade year of school. August has never attended a school before. He was homeschooled because of all of the surgeries he had as a child...for his face. ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse,"" August said concerning his severely tarnished face. Wonder takes you on a journey though the ups and downs of August's first school year. It also tells the perspective, thoughts, and experiences of some who were profoundly impacted by this ten year old boy (August's sister, his sister's boyfriend, his sister's friend, and his friends). 
 Firstly, the sensitive subject addressed in this book is handled pretty perfectly, in my opinion. It definitely changed my perspective on people like August. I seriously recommend reading this book to children; I believe it would help them be more understanding, unafraid, and kind to people who look different from the medium. 
 The characters are incredible. I love how Palacio told the story through different characters, rather than just August. August, Via/Olivia, his sister, and Jack, one of his friends, are my top three favorites. The way Palacio portrayed August was phenomenal. In one way, he was a regular, naive ten year old boy, yet at the same time, he was a wise old man who had been to hell and back. I fell in love with August. When reading Wonder, I cannot tell you how many times I wished I could reach into the pages and give August a hug. I laughed at his jokes and cried at his hardships and triumphs. I found myself relating to Via/Olivia a lot. Our experiences, personalities, and thoughts are very similar. Jack was an awesome character. You go from loving him to hating him to loving him again; I really like characters who make you teeter totter like that. 
 The lessons this book taught are timeless, relevant, and very, very true. The main message of Wonder is kindness. I think today's world often forgets to be kind. Wonder stresses that, ""It's not enough to be friendly. You have to be a friend."" The world we live in is so concerned about winning and being right; we often dismiss the fact that everyone needs kindness and love in order to thrive. Another quote from the book says, ""If every person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God."" 
 Overall, Wonder is a magnificent book. I honestly have no complaints about it. I highly recommend this book to every single person on the planet. This book portrays physical abnormalities in a perspective altering way; the characters are captivating and relatable; and the lessons are imperative, especially in today's world. This book has everything. It will make you laugh and cry. It will cause you to fall in love. It will change your life forever.

Auggie is different: he was born with severe facial deformities that have resulted in multiple operations, which have often left incredibly sick and have thus meant that he has never attended school, but has been consistently protected by his family, who adore him. Yet for all his difficulties, Auggie is also a sweet, caring and deeply moral young boy. 'Wonder' tells the story of Auggie's struggles during his first year at school not merely through his perspective, but also those around him, who sometimes struggle to accept him, sometimes struggle to befriend him and sometimes can only admire him. 
 One of the most engaging things about this novel was the way in which Palacio told the narrative from a range of perspectives not merely August's so that we could empathise with their points of views and understand their behaviour even when they perhaps made the wrong decision. There was also limited sentimentalisation over his condition: she did not shy away from revealing some of the more disturbing aspects of his condition or simply present everyone as being won over by Auggie's personality. Rather, she seemed to capture the struggles of the middle/ high school student perfectly and the difficulties they all experience in finding themselves and being accepted regardless of their appearance as they negotiate a new world and are forced to grow up, ready or not. Moreover, despite all these difficulties, the novel remained full of humour and was at once emotional and upbeat. It is rare that a book can make you shed a few tears, but this one genuinely did. There is something truly heart warming about 'Wonder'. I would recommend it to anyone who is feeling a little bit down or hard done by. Reading 'Wonder' not only makes you realise how lucky you are, but also how much better you can be.","Sun Apr 14 05:20:11 -0700 2013","Fri May 17 04:03:16 -0700 2013","Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"False"

 Auggie Pullman doesn't look like you or me, in fact he doesn't even look at all normal and for this reason alone he's never been to a proper school, until now. Auggie's journey through fifth grade is inspiring and uplifting and the characters who don't judge Auggie make me believe in the wonder of humanity again. 
 I just thought this was a truly amazing book. It made me cry, it made me cheer, it made me want to punch the air in triumph because of how Auggie faces the world. Kids like him are an inspiration and it's a shame the society sees them as outcasts or freaks.

It was based on a true story about a boy with a medical condition (I don't recall what exactly) and he had facial abnormalities. I loved that movie and couldn't help being reminded of it as I read this book. 
 Wonder was excellent and can probably be read in one sitting. As I was reading it, I was keeping in mind that if it was age appropriate, I would like my younger son to read it also. Then something happened in the book (the ""Halloween Incident"") that almost made we want to stop reading it. I'm glad I didn't! 
 The movie Mask came out in the politically incorrect 1980s and I was a teenager at the time. Even so, this movie had a big impact on me. But as I read Wonder I read it through a completely different lens. I read it as a mom of two young boys. I read it as the mom of a son with a severe developmental disability, with a sibling who will all too soon be navigating through the rough waters of middle school. I read it in 2012 where bullying just doesn't happen in school, but happens everywhere--on Facebook and through texts. I read it in a time where more and more headlines shock us with the fact that young children are taking their own lives as a result of bullying. As a parent this weighs on me, it keeps me up at night. I applaud R.J. Palacio by taking this subject on with finesse. 
 ***mild spoiler below*** 
 Unlike Mask this book had a happy ending, to my relief. It was inspirational and uplifting and I loved it! While my son isn't old enough to read this yet, I will introduce him to this book in the future, as it has a great message. I would recommend it to any preteen, parent, and teacher.","Sun May 27 19:40:31 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 22 08:08:16 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 22 08:08:16 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,2,""

I'd heard good things about the book for months, and liked the book trailer, but for some reason I kept finding other books to read instead. Even though I do like middle grade books, the subject matter of this one gave me pause. Anyway, the story is so engaging and uplifting, much more so than I had expected. Totally a worthwhile read and I'm so glad I finally read it. 
 10-year-old August Pullman was born with a severe facial abnormality. His parents home schooled him all of his life due to his frequent surgeries and medical appointments. Now, when others August's age are starting middle school, his parents think the time may be right for August to attend school as well. Auggie is a normal kid inside, smart and funny, and loves Star Wars and videogames. But will his new classmates be able to see past his outward appearance? 
 Auggie is so endearing- he won me over from the very first pages. I was so scared for him to start middle school. Middle school is terrifying under the best of circumstances! And even though Auggie has seen reactions of strangers around him all his life, it's hard to prepare yourself for this age group. I, like Auggie, hoped for the best but steeled myself for the worst. His experience has highs and lows and focuses in on a handful of students and teachers and the different ways they interact with Auggie. 
 There are a few kids assigned to keep an eye out for Auggie at school to show him around. Auggie is very perceptive about others and is a good judge of character- he really is a brave little guy. It's interesting to see the world through Auggie's eyes and then later revisit the same scenes through the eyes of his friends when the book shifts to multiple POV. I hadn't expected the book to shift POV actually, but it does satisfy some curiosity by hearing other characters perspective. Two of Auggie's classmates, as well as his sister, her friend, and boyfriend all take a turn at the narration. Auggie's sister Via is a standout character, as she shares the effect her brother has had on her life. 
 Hearing the different reactions to Auggie made me think about who I would be in the scenario, and I'd react in middle school if I had a classmate like him. My daughter and I had a dialogue about it, and you always hope you'd be compassionate, but it's hard to know what is the right way to respond in the moment. The book does a great job of making you think about how to treat people fairly and with compassion. The writing is accessible and has a light touch, even though there are some heavy and distressing scenes. It is just perfect for a middle grade audience, and to read aloud for class discussion or at home. But really I think this uplifting story is appealing for all ages.","Tue Feb 14 10:11:23 -0800 2012","Sun Aug 04 11:19:30 -0700 2013","Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,2,""

I also like the style of writing from different POV. It add a lot of missing pieces to the story. I think it reflects real life very well. This can also help to understand bullying and peer pressure. We can only see our side of the story. But with an open mind, we can begin to understand the view of other people. But even then, we are limited in our vision. This book introduces this topic very well. The main character has a great sense of humour so he is very likeable by readers. Some of the bullying jokes are actually a little funny, and it feels wrong to laugh at them. It can be useful for teaching students how to react during difficult, realistic situations.","Wed Apr 23 05:27:11 -0700 2014","Thu Feb 16 18:59:46 -0800 2017","Thu May 08 00:00:00 -0700 2014","",0,0,"False"

This is my favorite kind of novel--a kid that I like (even though he has flaws) battling huge obstacles. Auggie is going to regular school for the first time, having been home-schooled up through 4th grade. He has a severe facial deformity, so you can sort of imagine what he's up against. And he faces all of it, not with a fake bravery, but with a vulnerable spirit that makes you want to wave a magic wand and make everything better. But of course you can't. 
 One of the things I really love is that the pov changes throughout the novel. We start with Auggie and get to know him really well, but then the viewpoint changes to his older sister. A range of other kids, both Auggie's age and high school age as well, take their turns as viewpoint characters, which is really cool. In real life, the kid with the difference, the special need, the disease, whatever--that kid gets all the attention (good and bad) in a family, in society. But whatever affects one of us affects everyone close to that person. 
 I think every kid should read this novel, and there aren't many books I feel that way about! I finished it feeling uplifted and inspired, and trusting that most people really are good at heart (yes, it made me feel a bit Anne Frankish). And the people that aren't--the jerks and bullies who just aren't going to change--well, forget them. They will always be there, and they don't deserve your energy.","Tue Feb 12 04:04:55 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 12 04:12:56 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 12 04:12:56 -0800 2013","",0,0,"False"

 For those who don't know, Wonder is a book about a kid, August, whose face is ""deformed"" (though that word is discouraged in the book, it's the best way to describe it to someone who hasn't read it) because of a DNA thing. August doesn't have any disabilities or special needs, he just looks very different. Wonder follows his first year at a normal school, after being homeschooled most of his life. It's told in like 5 different POVs, and you can easily read it in one sitting. 
 I know that whatever I say in my review probably won't do it justice, considering it was the cutest thing I've ever read, really mind-opening and just full of happy feelings, but. I'll try. 
 The first thing I liked about this book was the writing style: R.J. Palacio writes in such a light and easy way, and the book is full (and I mean literally Full) of Star Wars references, which I really liked. You could also tell that the author is a David Bowie fan, as we see that August has an ongoing inside thing with Miranda where she calls him ""Major Tom"" and they listen to Space Oddity together, and Palacio kept using Bowie quotes wherever it was fitting (which made me really happy). Just, yes. Thank you. Plus, the chapters were really really short, and that made the book so fast-paced and impossible to get bored of since it was constantly changing. 
 Then, obviously, the story. It was so innocent and heart-warming and it made me cry (for like, 20 pages in a row). Especially one of the last scenes, the graduation award ceremony, oh my god. 
 ""'He is the greatest'"", he finally continued, ""'whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.' Without further ado, this year I am very proud to award the Henry Ward Beecher medal to the student whose quiet strength has carried up the most hearts. 
 ""So will August Pullman please come up here to receive this award?"" 
 MAANNN. August gets up to receive an award for bravery and strength while all his friends, teachers, classmates, classmates' parents, are clapping and smiling really big and standing up for him, and it's just the cutest scene in any book ever, because in a previous chapter August had said: ""I imagined how cool it would be to be Via and Justin right then, having all these people standing up and cheering for them. I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" , and in that moment he actually gets his own standing ovation, everyone in the crowd crying (me included, okay). Just: 
 And as I walked up the steps to the stage, the most amazing thing happened: everyone started standing up. Not just the front rows, but the whole audience suddenly got up on their feet, whooping, hollering, clapping like crazy. It was a standing ovation. For me. 
 Oh damn oh damn ! Oh Dang! I can't stand things that soft and that cute because Too Many Feelings. It was great. August describes how he had the Star Wars song playing in his head, the one that was playing in A New Hope when Luke, Han & Chewie come back from destroying the Death Star, and this makes me too happy. I should stop, cause if I don't do now I don't know when I will. 
 But please, please read this if you haven't already. :)","Wed Jan 06 07:06:25 -0800 2016","Sun Jul 03 12:50:26 -0700 2016","Sun Jun 26 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 -0700 2016",10,0,"False"

 It is very easy to connect to endearing August (mc), after all we've all been bullied or cast aside at one point in our life. So we know how it feels, we can very well imagine how August must feel, and yet we rarely see him weep in his room. It is uplifting to read a book about a brave boy who is and manages to remain sympathetic and positive despite everything he has to endure. 
 The story is told from different perspectives, thus offering an insight what each of these characters was feeling and it wasn't all roses for them either. There was a lesson there: no matter how bad you're off, don't feel sorry for yourself, because someone else might be happy to trade places with you. All the bad things that happen in life, sometimes make us blind for all the good things we still have. 
 The only thing I didn't like at all was the far too perfect ending. Everything is neatly solved and tucked away in a sweet and saccharine way that left me with the need to brush my teeth. Nothing wrong with that, but it is incongruous with the rest of the story. For the most part the characters and most events seemed genuine, realistic even, the good, the sad and the bad. The ending however, is pure phantasy. Maybe life is that perfect somewhere, but I have never seen it happen. Kindness does not magically overrule it all, the power of bigotry, prejudice and plain old meanness is always a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately. And to just sweep it under the rug in oder to end the book on a positive note, is a bit too simple.","Sun Aug 28 20:15:54 -0700 2016","Sat Oct 01 16:46:54 -0700 2016","Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 -0700 2016","",4,0,"False"

 the book is about August who is NOT deformed and doesn't have special needs but he has this genetic thing and he had a cleft plate and basically lots of problems with his face which means he is 'ugly' or looks like a 'zombie' as his features are not where they should be eg his eyes are lower and his ears are tiny and not properly formed etc. 
 so anyways when people see august they cry out in horror or stare in shock or look away quickly. he is used to it. 
 this has made life hard for august and his family because whenever they go out or whatever people stare and whisper etc 
 so august is 10 and has been home schooled but his parents think it might be time for proper school. not a special school just a normal school. august isn't so pleased but soon he find she loves school and he starts making friends even though most of the school hate him and it took a few months for everyone to get used to his face etc. 
 i mean imagine a 10yr old boy having to cope with this? his whole life? like he just sees himself as ordinary, yes he hates his face but he can joke about himself and he is a funny, intelligent little kid and so lovely and THAT is what makes him who he is. 
 i love how the book is written from different perspectives so it's mostly from August's POV but also his sister Olivia and his friend Jack and then some other people and i love books like that because there is no one side to a story. and also shows how August touches everyone's lives and also not just about August but how other people have to deal with it as well. 
 i mean imagine hearing someone say that 'if i looked like him i'd kill myself'. :| 
 people can be so mean. especially kids. sometimes they mean it and other times they don't but it still hurts. 
 and having people pity you and treat you differently etc. august just wants to be a normal kid. but yeah sometimes he does act baby-ish etc but school has been good for him. 
 anyways i just love this book. it's quite funny and just makes you think about how grateful you should be for not having to deal with anything like that UNLESS you do...like you are in a wheelchair or you don't have an arm or whatever it is. it's not easy having people stare at you and pity you. 
 anyways i love the whole precepts thing. 
 and my fave thing was when mr tushman said 'always try to be a little kinder than necessary' - J.M.Barrie which is just beautiful. 
 so yeah read this book, it's not long and it will change your perspective on things and it's just beautiful. and i may or may not have teared up a few times. but then laughed.

The perspective shifts between several characters, which felt very effective and allowed the story to be about both August's own experiences and the way other kids and teens interact with him. The writing is straightforward but the style still feels lovely, somehow. 
 There was one plot element that spoiled the potential emotional resonance of the story. At the graduation ceremony, when the principal is about to give out the special Beecher award, I knew what was coming and began cringing. As I read the story, there were many things I felt that other kids learned from being around Auggie, but he never struck me as a lesson in kindness. Perhaps his presence encouraged the other kids to learn to be kinder? But Auggie himself never exemplified the spirit of kindness. He was just being a normal kid. And giving him an award for kindness completely detracts from that aspect of the book and undermines what I thought was the primary theme of the story. That issue aside, I thought the story and characters were well-constructed and I enjoyed reading it.

Palacio while listening to NPR; it was the September selection for the NPR Backseat book club which is a book club for young readers. I was immediately taken with the story's premise and then really loved the author interview. I also really enjoyed the passages of the book being read by fifth graders. Even though we did not select it for our book club, I was excited to read it and LOVED the characters and the story. 
 Besides Auggie, my favorite character is Summer. She is warm, funny, and kind. The book captures the complexity of middle school really well; in particular, the struggle to fit in while doing right by your fellow humans. Many of the scenes made me cry; I was especially moved by the lunch room image of Auggie sitting by himself. I was brought back to the anxiety and worry of having someone to sit with at lunch. I also keep thinking about the emperor's guard chapter which makes me want to high-five humanity.

Since I had to read it for my Children's Resources course, I was expecting to feel ""meh"" about reading it. Y'know, since no one likes to have to read for school -- even those of us who love to read, like I do. 
 And yet I ended up loving this book. 
 This is the story of August Pullman, a boy born with a cleft palate, among many other facial issues. He's been homeschooled up until fifth grade, when his parents decide to enroll him in Beecher Prep for middle school. 
 I think I was also wary of this book because stories about characters with disabilities or sicknesses or what have you tend to do one of two things: 1) use the character's problem as a device to manipulate the reader's emotions (rather than making it a part of the character's identity), thus coming off as almost romanticized in a warped way (in my opinion, this is what stuff like The Fault in Our Stars and Me Before You are guilty of), or 2) become cliche, completely lack in creativity, and horribly misrepresent those with the disability/sickness/what have you. 
 But Wonder doesn't do that. It is clear that Palacio did her research on these types of physical issues and that she learned what it is like, not just for the person born with the problem, but for their family, friends, and even total strangers around them. What I loved about this book was Palacio's skill at exploring this topic from multiple and diverse viewpoints, from Auggie himself to the sister's boyfriend Justin. Each of these characters had distinct voices; Palacio is a very skilled writer of characters. 
 I was going to give the book five stars. However, the very last section of the acknowledgments made me take a star off. Palacio apparently based the story off of a real-life encounter at an ice cream stand with a little GIRL who was born like Auggie. Or at least that is the impression I got. Which made me question two things: why did she make Auggie a boy, and not a girl? And why did Palacio use only her first two initials for her name on the front cover? 
 For the same reason J.K. Rowling uses hers, of course: perhaps the publishers told her they wanted this book to appeal to boys and girls. Because ""boys don't read books about girls."" Right? 
 This maybe isn't the fault of Palacio herself, but rather the industry and our society as a whole. But still, it was disappointing to read about that encounter, and made me wonder how much different and how much more impactful the story could have been were August instead named Augusta. There are even more issues of gender expectations that could have been explored. But, oh well.","Wed Nov 16 20:08:50 -0800 2016","Wed Jun 14 12:19:10 -0700 2017","Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Wed Nov 16 00:00:00 -0800 2016",1,0,""

You see, ""Auggie,"" as he's known to family and friends was born with severe facial deformities, and the intensity of surgeries he experienced made home schooling a better choice to this point. But now, his parents and he have decided it's time to learn how to face the world (no pun intended) outside the bubble of family, house and safety. 
 You can rightly predict what will happen next: some meanies and bullies, some nice people who see Auggie's deeper worth, some imperfect human characters who start out nice but have mean moments (and vice versa). Luckily, what could be a cloying ABC Afterschool Special of a novel is saved by the vibrancy of Auggie's narrative voice. Unfortunately, Palacio chooses to shift POV voices throughout the book, resulting in a string of narrators that are insufficiently distinct from one another (with the exception of Auggie's older sister's emo-e.e. cummings boyfriend) and whose internal monologues don't add enough fresh perspective to the story. 
 So: enjoyable, charming, but not a home run.","Sat Dec 03 20:24:25 -0800 2016","Tue Aug 01 18:24:03 -0700 2017","Sun Jul 30 20:08:34 -0700 2017","Tue Jul 25 19:16:22 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 This is a book about August who was born with severe facial deformities. Deformities so severe, that there was doubt that he would survive when he was born. He had a plethora of surgeries to repair his deformities so that the things we take for granted,like chewing,would become easier. 
 He was bright and homeschool by his Mother up until 5/6 grade when his parents decided he should go to private school with children his own age. 
 This book is about an extraordinary family, a lionhearted child and a wonderful,supportive cast . 
 Of course,there are bumps along the way and a bully or two,but overall this was a feel good little book.

This story from the perspective of a boy with severe facial abnormalities and the perspective of some those close to him provides fantastic thoughtful discussion. 
 For children: what sort of person do you want to be? The kind that tears others down, or someone who is kind even when it's hard? 
 For adults: how can we teach kindness to our kids when dealing with others who have obvious and less obvious special needs? How can we teach compassion?

 I felt like I could really connect to Auggie. He isn't a typical character who has a facial abnormality. He is a funny, kind boy. I thought this book made me realize the different types of people out there. Maybe there are people like Auggie out there. When Auggie described his feelings, I felt like I was the and experiencing everything through his eyes. 
 The different view points were really interesting. I liked the many p.o.v's. I'm sure that my fellow classmates did as well. I really liked the kids who stuck by Auggie. I admire them. 
 The other thing too, the short chapters, they were really easy to read. So, if you hate long chapters, this book is for you.

Palacio does a good job of setting the scene and really allowing you to feel like you're part of the characters' lives. In the first section, where we get to know Auggie, I was really drawn in. So much so that I was initially disappointed when the perspective switched to Via's... although that ended up being my favourite part of the book. It felt so authentic! 
 And therein lies my main issue with 'Wonder': the authenticity. While the first half felt very real, the ending was too perfect. Everything comes together in a tidy manner, out heroes are happy and the 'bad guy' leaves. Case closed. But life isn't really like that and writing it into a book that is otherwise so good is disappointing. 
 That said, I generally enjoyed this book. It was a quick, mostly engaging read with a lovely central message: Choose kindness.

Y nos quedamos con eso: si nos gusta el aspecto fisico le damos una oportunidad a esa persona, y si no, nos limitamos a quedarnos en el exterior. Juzgamos a una persona por su aspecto fisico y creemos conocer todo de esa persona por como es, por la organizacion de sus rasgos, por su forma de hablar, de reir, de caminar, de vestir...

 Palacio, R J, Nick Podehl, Kate Rudd, and Diana Steele. Wonder. Grand Haven, MI: Brilliance Audio, 2011. Sound recording. 
 August Pullman is called Auggie for short by his friends and supportive family and Zombie Kid by the kids in fifth grade at his new school. However, not all of the fifth graders call him that. Jack and Summer, Auggie's only two friends refuse to take part in the atrocious treatment Auggie receives from his classmates. Due to birth defects and rare medical conditions August has immense facial deformities, causing the kids at school to refuse to touch Auggie for fear of ""The Plague"". Auggie is unsure how to deal with the typical ways in which children interact with each other as he has been home-schooled for his entire life. He soon experiences the harsh realities of middle school as an outcast, such as betrayal, fake friendships, and the joys of finding someone to spend lunch periods with. Auggie's sister Via is also experiencing a new reality as she begins her first year in high school. She recognizes that her family's lives must revolve around her younger brother's needs, but has problems and new experiences of her own with old friend Miranda and new boyfriend Justin. Read by a cast representing the voices of August, Via, Summer, Jack, Justin, and Miranda this audiobook is a thoughtful examination of the way human beings treat one another. Readers have the opportunity to learn how to empathize.

 ""My name is August, by the way, I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 I fell in love with August the first time he spoke until the end of his story. This book is beautifully told through the eyes of different people, through August, his friends and most touching and heartbreakingly so by his older sister, Olivia. There are so many gems in this book and teaching moments that truly stick with you. I hope this is true for the younger kids who will read it. This is a book that everyone should try, it may bring back some of that lost compassion we sometimes forget about as adults. 
 I had many emotive moments during the audio and also had some big smiles along the way. I can only say this is truely a wonder and it would be a gift for anyone to read it.

 The characters are very real and the scenario is very typical of middle school culture. You will recognize kids you went to school with. 
 Auggie, through the lottery of genetics, has been born with facial deformities that cause people to look away. Even though he has endured multiple surgeries, he does not look ""normal"" on the outside, but on the inside, he is quite a ""normal"" boy. He has always been home schooled, but when he reaches middle school age, his parents feel he should enter school and learn to deal with society's various reactions to him. 
 And the reactions are varied, running the gamut from horror to bullying, acceptance to love. 
 This book makes the reader confront the question of what makes a person who they are, and accepting others for more than the superficial.

His parents had always homeschooled him, until recently when they decided that he had to be a ""normal boy"" and go to a regular school. But with his face condition, how can he ever be treated like a normal boy? How would he even be treated? 
 In her first novel, Palacio has written a wonderful story, a ""modern classic"". In the first couple of pages, as we start to get to know our main character the story might seem to be a bit boring. But as you keep reading you will grow to love ""Auggie"" and sympathize with his struggle of wanting to be treated like a normal kid, apart from the fact of the way that his face looks. 
 As you read you will not only be seeing things from August's point of view but you will also see them from the people surrounding him. As if telling a story from a first persons point of view isn't hard enough, the author changes between the mind of Augustus and other characters, related to him, to aid her in her storytelling. By doing so she helps us, not only to understand the reactions of the characters but as well as their emotions and thoughts. By changing to points of views from different characters and reading how they feel I, myself, couldn't help but engage on how real their emotions felt. 
 It was a surprisingly heartwarming story. Very well written, fast and easy to read. If you are in the mood for something nice and easy to read I would definitely recommend this book to you. And if you are going to read it, make sure that as you get closer to the ending you have a box of tissues near you, because it's beauty will most certainly touch your heart.","Sat Mar 15 06:57:24 -0700 2014","Mon Apr 21 09:17:33 -0700 2014","Sat Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",0,0,""

A story of how hard school can be, through the eyes of a young boy and his family and friends. 
 What first drew my interest was that it revolved around disability/deformity, a challenging thing to address. Secondly, that it would pay attention to a student starting school altogether -- where even starting a new school, like primary or secondary, even college, can be a stressful milestone -- and what sort of influence that can have over a child or teenager. This was something I could relate to on a personal level, and along with the original concept, looked forward to where this story would go. 
 Upon first reading this quote, expectations shot through the roof. A very true statement, in a sense, though the need to protect might not necessarily depend on how a person looks, rather just an instinctual thing between siblings. It did hold promise of future conflict, despite the fairly simple start. Unfortunately, not much excitement nor tension came to light -- a story revolving around the simplicity of school life isn't bad; in fact, it is a favourite setting of mine, but must be supported by strong conflict. Wonder had conflict, but sadly weakened with childish behaviour from classmates, which had that element of bullying been expanded on further, may have kept my attention until the end. For the point of view changes, though I have nothing against them, if not done well or suit the story, they can really dwindle the story or message the book is trying to make. 
 The style did not make up for the lack of conflict, with unclear direction and a dialogue that seemed too juvenile for a ten and/or eleven year old. As was the theme of this book. Where disability was the main subject matter, and was shown, again it wasn't strong. Age might be the key here, in that perhaps children would not take it so seriously, but if that were so, it did not show that careful power and impact that a book about disability I would assume to have. 
 All characters were hard to connect with; they did not possess a strong personality, besides Via's need to protect and temper when it came to dealing with those bullies. 
 It was sad to put this book down after only a hundred pages, when seeing so much potential before. I take my hat off to Palacio for attempting to write about a sensitive subject; some might think it did a good job of it, however I did not. I, personally, would not recommend it, but then again it is something different to try.","Tue Jul 15 07:34:51 -0700 2014","Wed Dec 10 08:31:24 -0800 2014","Mon Jul 28 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 -0700 2014",1,0,""

This is one of the precepts provided to the reader of WONDER, a novel by P.J. Palacio. The book is full of wonderful messages and insights into the struggles of August Pullman, a 5th grade boy who has a rare craniofacial deformity. It's a book of empathy and compassion intertwined with the realities of the world. As a counselor who works with children, I think it's a wonderful book for students who find themselves struggling with acceptance and for those who feel misunderstood. Beyond that, it's a novel that should be read by all students as it challenges each child to find within themselves the ability to be kind and compassionate in the face of differences. 
 Because WONDER is really a children's novel, I gave it three stars based on the writing style. Really, that kind of criteria for rating isn't fair as I'm judging a children's book based on adult tastes. However, if I were to rate the book based on the message alone, I would give it five stars. Consider the following excerpt from the book that speaks to the theme and message of WONDER: ""...I came upon a passage that Henry Ward Beecher (the nineteenth century abolitionist and defender of human rights) wrote that seemed particularly consistent with the themes I've been ruminating upon all year long. Not just the nature of kindness, but the nature of one's kindness. The power of one's friendship. The test of one's character. The strength of one's courage. Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness."" 
 Every school should have this book on their reading list. Children would be made to expand their understanding through the thought-provoking precepts and messages provided throughout the novel. Bravo to P.J. Palacio for writing a book worthy of our children and our expectations for them regarding their character.","Wed Feb 12 10:56:55 -0800 2014","Wed Feb 12 18:15:16 -0800 2014","Tue Feb 11 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",2,0,""

 August is entering fifth grade and he's going to school for the first time. He's been home-schooled until now and his preciosity is making it hard for his parents to keep up with teaching him at home. He's full of the adolescent awkwardness and self doubt we all remember. But August isn't actually an ""ordinary"" kid. He's been home schooled because he's needed 20+ surgeries on his face to address a severe birth defect, with the simple goal of survival. So this story is really about what it's like to be an extraordinary kid who is always stared at, or who is never looked at, because he looks different. And as told from the perspective of August, his classmates, and his sister, it also carries an underlying question: if August was your classmate, would you have included him or shunned him? Would you do better today?","Sun Jan 05 22:35:37 -0800 2014","Fri Jun 13 21:56:46 -0700 2014","Thu May 15 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Wed May 14 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 I liked reading from each character's POV. It gave insight on how each person saw Auggie. It was realistic in how the characters acted towards him. His life consisted of bullies and a lot of challenges, not everything was flowery and good. The novel progressed nicely in portraying how people came around to accepting Auggie when they were originally so afraid of him. 
 This is definitely a book that pleases all audiences. I'm not typically a young adult reader, but I enjoyed this a lot. I'd recommend this to preteens through adults. It's a feel good book that all ages enjoy.","Sat Mar 01 11:35:28 -0800 2014","Sun Mar 16 15:04:17 -0700 2014","","",0,0,""

I was afraid it would be overwhelmingly sad, and I like to keep my reading happy and light. But, just from reading the summary, I had to know more about August and his story and decided to request the book. 
 And I'm so glad I did, because Wonder was an excellent read. It is told from several points-of-view, which I love because I really got to know several of the characters. I loved reading about the same events from different points-of-view. It's neat to see how different people view the same event. Everyone has their own interpretation of things. 
 Wonder answers the question: how does it feel to be the person other people stare at? The one that causes people do a double-take when they see you? Everyone has probably seen someone different and looked twice, or looked from the corner of their eye (to keep from staring). August catches all of these looks, as well as ugly comments, and nothing escapes his notice. To see how much people's reactions affect August and his family was truly heart-breaking. 
 I went from laughing on one page to crying on the next, this book was that emotional. I was in awe of August's strength of character and unfailing positive outlook (as well as his parents'). 
 I thought that Wonder would feel very young, since it is written mainly from a 10-year-old's point of view, but it did not. August is mature for his age and his voice was sometimes young, but sometimes much older than a 10 year-old's should be. He has to grow up fast due to his abnormalities and his narrative voice reflects that. 
 The book ends on a positive note, although that did not stop me from crying yet again, just due to how emotional the book was on the whole. I loved it and think everyone should read about August!","Thu Feb 16 16:01:42 -0800 2012","Thu Mar 22 09:14:30 -0700 2012","Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 -0800 2012",1,0,""

 This story is about August- a ten year old boy who was born with severe facial deformities and is attending school for the first time ever this year. As you can imagine, there are a lot of challenges that Auggie experiences during his first year of school (most of them regarding his social relationships with his peers). 
 It's well written and flows well- which is commendable considering that it's always a little difficult for books with multiple narrators to avoid choppiness (and there are six in this one). However, there are a handful of problematic aspects to this novel that I just can't get over. I can't say them specifically without spilling major spoilers but I will say that Auggie was given a belittling ending only with bells and whistles attached to make it seem like he was being celebrated. This detracted significantly from Auggie's character (which is a shame because his character is great and deserved a much better conclusion) and, instead of making him a unique and whole person, left him as a flat mascot for ""different"" kids. 
 I will say that I love Auggie's family. Were they complex, 3D characters? No, not really, but I was self-indulgent in enjoying them for how loving, kind and sweet they are.","Wed Aug 06 13:09:21 -0700 2014","Wed Aug 06 15:49:48 -0700 2014","","",0,0,""

 This is a ""feel good"" book where everyone (save for the one cardboard bad character and his family) find the better angels of their nature. The last section of the book (from the camp sequence on) is as predicatable as can be and the ending is perfect and satisfying and as phoney as a $3 bill.

Imagine dealing with the typical school issues (opposite sex, hierarchy of groups, invites to parties ... this is before we even get into grades) when you also have a disability? Then imagine the disability is a physical one. 
 That is the challenge that meets August. August was born with a facial deformity. He is approaching grade 5 and after dealing with surgeries and hospital visits most of his life, his parents feel he is ready to bridge from home schooling to main stream school. August lives with his very loving parents, older sister Via who is 'normal' and his dog Daisy. 
 This very powerful and moving book by first time author R. J. Palacio is a touching story of August, his family and the friends he made in his first year at mainstream school. From the incredible first paragraph with the sentences: 
 I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year old kid. ... But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever the go. 
 You are hooked into August's life and boy what a life he leads. It's an emotional roller coaster as you find yourself wanting to protect this fictional character. The author captures the awkward feelings everyone has felt in 'middle school' from the sitting alone at the lunch table to the cliques that every school seems to have. August has to deal with these plus know that everyone is avoiding him. Well, not everyone. 
 August's new head teacher, Mr Tushman, has arranged for students Jack, Julian and Charlotte to come to the school over the summer to show August around. While on the tour, we can start to sense some of August anxiety but also the willingness of some kids wanting to get past the 'looks'. 
 The book is one that you continue to think about days after reading it. I was told it was geared to kids but really don't think that this is a book that can be pigeon holed into one genre. The writing is beautifully crafted to embrace the many complex emotions most of us has ensured at one time or another. It also covers many difficulties that people of all ages continue to battle in adulthood.

He's about to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances? 
 Wow, I don't even know how to write a review for this book because whatever I write won't do it justice. This story is powerful and beautifully written. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will come away with a stronger resolve to be a better person. I absolutely loved Auggie. He just wanted to be treated like a ""normal"" kid and had a great attitude in spite of the fact that people were constantly staring at him, bullying him, and making him feel like he was a monster. Surprisingly, the story was told through six different viewpoints which really allows the reader to learn more about Auggie through the eyes of other people, including his sister Via. She wasn't always perfect but she was the best sister anyone could have. And Summer--we all want a friend like her and most of us wish we would react to Auggie like she did. But would we? Especially when we were in the 5th grade? The speech given by Mr. Tushman at graduation was touching and reminds us all what a difference kindness makes. 
 --""Shall we make a new rule of life . . . Always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary? What a marvelous line, isn't it? Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed. Why I love that line, that concept, is that it reminds me that we carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness. If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary--the world really would be a better place."" 
 This is a wonderful story of courage, love and the reminder of what a little kindness can do. Although it was written for middle school students, everyone can benefit from reading this book. As a former elementary school teacher, I think this is a great book to use as a read-aloud starting in 3rd grade. If I still had children at home, I would be reading it with them too.","Tue Mar 27 16:09:55 -0700 2012","Wed May 20 09:04:27 -0700 2015","Thu Jun 13 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Tue Jun 11 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,1,"False"

I can't tell you how many times my heart squeezed in pain for Auggie. But not only him. Because this book is so character driven (with 6 or 7 character POVs - which I thought would be annoying but proved otherwise), you can relate to each person. You see how everyone has their roles, and everyone thinks they are doing what's best, whether it is or isn't. And how when you are in a family with a child that has a disability or deformity it puts strain on the whole family. And the friends of the family. Everyone is affected. 
 It tells the true story of how in schools all over the country kids are being bullied for much less than having a disability of some form or another. How sticking up for or defending or befriending someone could guarantee you bullying. 
 But I think the biggest story behind it all is to do what's right. We've all been there before. No matter how low or high you are on the totem pole of popularity - we've made fun of someone ""lower"" than us. But all it is, is a ploy to make ourselves feel better about our own lives. This is about sticking together and lifting eachother up no matter what the circumstances are. 
 This book will be a read aloud I do this coming school year, and I'll probably wait to read it until after the holiday break, right around when bullying and ugliness starts to spread like wildfire around the room, and I hope it hits my furture students in a sensitive spot that will change the way they treat people forever.","Sat Jun 30 13:20:28 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 22 09:56:24 -0700 2012","Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,"False"

August, ""Auggie"" is an ordinary ten-year-old boy, except for one thing, he has a deformed face. Like the Elephant Man, he is shunned by society. He is lucky though as he was born into a wonderful family. His parents and older sister love him very much. They are overprotective, of course, but encourage him to try attending a normal school for his fifth grade. (He has been homeschooled up to now.) What happens in his fifth-grade year makes the story.

He has always had the same friend from when he was younger until Christopher had to move out of state with his family. Since that happen Auggie has kept himself to himself and only really spends time with his parents and sister, Via and also his dog Daisy. 
 I loved how Auggie was narrating it and how his words just leapt from page. There were some parts of the novel were I was close to tears and then at some parts I was sobbing my heart out. Auggie has had a lot to deal with his whole life and his has dealt with it so well, I know that if I had a facial deformity I wouldn't of been able to cope with people stopping and staring at me. Auggie coped with this amazingly and he just wanted to be treated like a normal person. 
 When Auggie starts at school he is helped along by 3 people, Charlotte, Jack and Julian. All of them seem very shocked at who they are helping around the school. They all have different opinions of who Auggie is and why he looks different from everyone else. There are so many names that are thrown around, orc, zombie and elephant man but Auggie doesn't react to any of those names and just carries on his life as normal. 
 Auggie meets Summer on the first day of school at lunch time when she comes and sits on the same table as him and suggests that they should be friends as their names are both from the same season. When I read this I thought that it was really sweet of Summer. I did though have a deep thought that she was only doing this for a dare but I learnt further in the book that Summer like Auggie for his humour and personality and not just cause she could of been told to be friends with him. 
 There is so much that I can say about this book, but it would give away too much of the plot. All I can say is that it is the most amazing book that I have read for the year or so. The way it is written is with lots of thought and understanding of how a person would feel and be like with a deformity of any kind. R.J Palacio has a fantastic way with words and makes you feel like you are there with Auggie everyday going through what he is going through. If there is one book that you should pick up this year, make sure it is Wonder as it is truly a remarkable novel and I haven't read anything like it since Jenny Downham brought Before I Die to the publishing world.","Sun Mar 18 13:13:37 -0700 2012","Tue May 01 12:41:21 -0700 2012","Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",3,1,""

When it came in for me and I added it to my Goodreads list I saw that my nephew had also read it and liked it. 
 This is a kids book, but that is okay because some of my favorite books are kids books. The main character, August ""Auggie"" Pullman, is a 10 year old boy that was born with some pretty severe facial deformities. Because of that and some other medical issues that went along with it he is home schooled through the 4th Grade. But for the 5th Grade his parents convince him to reluctantly agree to attend a regular school. I say a regular school but it is a private school, so not completely regular. The book is about Auggie's 5th grade year at Beecher Prep Middle School. It is told in sections from several different perspectives. Auggie's, of course, some family members, and some friends. Some of the sections overlap a little so that you read about some events from two or even three perspectives. I read the book over only 2 days so it was pretty easy not to get confused but if you read it over a longer period of time I suppose you might forget who was speaking or what others had said about the events. The author tried to write each section differently so that you could kind of ""hear"" that characters voice. The only one that I really did not like was Justin's where no capital letters were used. That was a little weird and distracting. 
 I thought that the characters and the book were very realistic. One thing about many kids books is that the good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad. Like it is in real life, however, the characters in this book go both ways. Sometimes the good guys make mistakes and sometimes the bad guys aren't all that bad. The ending was predictable but that is not always a bad thing. I read some reviews that said that there were too many little side storylines that did not seem necessary. In my opinion that is how life is. There is what we are trying to do and there are the big things that happen to us. Then there are all of the little things that happen to us as well. If you were telling someone the story of your life for a year you could not go into detail about everything that happened to and around you, yet if you left some things out completely the story would be incomplete. I thought the author struck a good balance. 
 There are probably several morals that can be found in this book. I'm sure that when this book is read by a Middle School class there are many ""teaching moments"" that the teacher will bring out and that will be the topic of essay questions. It is also a fun story to read and one that I am glad that I read.","Wed Nov 20 18:43:13 -0800 2013","Fri Nov 22 19:28:17 -0800 2013","Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Wed Nov 20 00:00:00 -0800 2013",1,0,""

 There was a lot of people all over social media talking about how much they adored this book - so obviously I had to pick it up! And it was definitely super cute, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I was going to. I'm a sucker for middle-grade novels, and this one was entertaining and everything, but I think it's my lack of interest in realistic fiction that made me not enjoy it as much as others. I'm not one for slice-of-life books/comics/anything really because I always say ""why would I read something that could actually happen?"" which explains my love of fantasy. I always just find realistic fiction super boring because there are never exciting plots or action. This novel was cute, definitely. But it didn't capture me at all. I loved a couple of the characters, but I almost felt like they could have gone into greater detail with a few of them. As well as the fact that it had almost no plot except the fact that Auggie had a syndrome that made his face a bit screwed up. There was no set plot, which made me question why I was reading it, and it made me not care to continue usually because there was nothing I was looking forward to. 
 I do suggest people who LIKE realistic fiction read it - all those people who like metaphors and morals and a greater meaning to things would love it. But I personally wasn't all that impressed.","Sun Sep 14 09:56:50 -0700 2014","Sun Oct 26 12:03:37 -0700 2014","Sun Oct 26 12:03:37 -0700 2014","Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"False"

The lack of importance of our physicality is just the beginning. The need for simple kindness is just the surface.

They were minor characters and I understand their part in the story but dedicating an entire section to each of them seemed a bit pointless. They didn't do much for the story and I would have liked it better if the author stuck to Auggie's, Summer's, Jack's, and Via's point of view. Also, what was up with Justin's section? There was no capitalization and seemed more like a train of thought. I didn't understand the reasoning behind that type of narration; it just didn't fit with the rest of the book.

 Finally, a book that lives up to its title! 
 Actual Rating: 4.00 
 Plus Points: 
 Simple. It doesn't need highfalutin words to give validity to the essence of the story. It also helps because it's set in a child's POV, so it makes everything a lot less complicated and straightforward. (And obviously, because of the genre it is in) 
 Different POVs. I wasn't actually expecting different POV's from other characters however it was interesting to see their own story and what they have to say. It's nice to see how the story progresses and translates to different characters. Judging a character is inevitable, I know. But this book gave (almost) everyone a chance to speak up and defend themselves. Also having different POV allowed the reader to see characters in different lighting. 
 Compelling. The plot is just gorgeous. I haven't seen books that talk about deformity as subtle and heavy as this one. 
 I like the fact that not everything was centered in Augustus' facial deformity. I wasn't expecting this to have an impact on me, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't. It was just amazing how R. J. Palacio put something sensitive (facial deformity) and translates it into an innocent child's POV. It was compelling because you wouldn't expect a child to go around with facial deformity and say it's okay. 
 However, I was really hoping to read Augustus parents POV especially his mom. Throughout the story she was the one that felt very quite and distant, it left me wondering why and what lead her to be that way. That's the only thing that bugs me. 
 Do I like it: Yes!

A character so moving, so special, and so inspiring... so alive. Wonder is a book in which the main character has made the decision to enter Middle School after being home schooled. It is a decision that will leave him vulnerable and exposed. A courageous step beyond the safety of his family. 
 Meet Auggie (August Pullman), who was born with a facial deformity, intelligence, and courage. All of his life he has endured the devastating looks, reactions, and fearfulness of strangers. Now is the time for him to become a student among many who are finding their way as middle school students. Given the ""all encompassing"" emotions and hormonal changes, middle school can be a roller coaster of fear, bullying, anger, and uncertainty. Why would Auggie want to begin public school at such a time is beyond reasoning for most of us. Yet, Auggie is blessed beyond measure with courage and a determination to live without ""superficial"" boundaries. 
 ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. 
 I mean, sure, I do ordinary things.... 
 But I know ordinary kids don't make other kids 
 run away screaming in playgrounds."" 
 Mr. Tushman of Beecher Prep school has prearranged a meeting with Auggie and his mother before the first day of school. Like any ordinary ""new"" student, Auggie will meet some of the staff and tour the school. It is with great foresight, that Auggie's tour is lead by a few ""homeroom"" students: 
 Jack is the first student that will extend friendship in the halls and classrooms. Yet, at some point he will need to decide if he wants to fit in with his old friends or stay friends with Auggie. 
 Jullian is rude and obnoxious (you know that type that acts one way with adults and another with students). The type that is loud, arrogant, and will not let Auggie escape being bullied. When push comes to shove, Auggie will demonstrate true character strength. The question will be if Jullian will learn acceptance of Auggie as an ""ordinary"" kid... and a friend? 
 Charlotte is an ""artsy"" girl. She enjoys all aspects of school, including science. She doesn't waiver in her support for Auggie, unless maybe it's in the lunch room. Will Charlotte be strong enough to overcome peer pressure? 
 Mr. Browne is Auggie's English teacher. He values his students and begins school with learning about precepts (any important thought, motto, or saying that guides you when making really important decisions). His students will write-to-learn a new precept every month: 
 ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, 
 choose kind."" 
 Dr. Wayne W. Dyer 
 Summer is the first student who braves the whispers in the lunch room and chooses to sit at the table with Auggie. It might seem a small gesture to many... but not only will it prove to be a courageous step towards friendship... it will also be an experience of a life time for both of them. 
 Whether it is Auggie's first birthday party, the first Halloween school event, the first school trip (outdoor school away from home), or the first meeting with his sister's high school friends... Auggie is on a life-changing quest... to be just another ""ordinary kid!"" 
 The depth of characterization will leave a lasting ""thumb-print"" upon every reader's heart. Those middle school experiences will be confirmed and/or ""pushed"" to a new level of awareness with dignified choices. The story line is expertly woven between Auggie's story and the voices of those who are changed by their encounters with Auggie. 
 There is so much that Auggie offers, care enough to experience the ""Wonder,""

 I loved this. I got annoyed that August thought the world revolved around him, that was his parents fault.

And I loved how much Auggie grew up within that year, he gained so much confidence and he's such a brave little boy. 
 I loved his friends but I felt in Jack's part that the author was trying too hard to be cool and do that ""get down with the kids"" thing, but nevertheless I loved Jack and Summer. I really wish the author would make another book of August, Jack, and Summer for when they're about 17 or so; see what adventures they get up to being teens, and watch Jack and Summer fall for each other. 
 I felt so bad for Olivia; I agreed with her about everything and I'm so glad things worked out for her because although she's only fictional, she deserved all the good that life could give her. 
 And I found the party thing with the 10 year olds a bit hard to believe, and the dating. Just what. That's why also seeing them as teens would be interesting.

 I loved this book. Although I believe this was meant to be a middle grade read, it seriously transcends age range. R.J. Palacio has done well in writing a book to inspire many a generation. 
 While most would assume it's a book about 'not caring what people think of you, and just be yourself' yadda yadda, I felt a stronger undertone. For me, it was more so a book about living life to the fullest, and treating people with compassion. Simply to look past what people are doing in the moment, and accept them as they are. 
 R.J. did a wonderful job in making Auggie real. She showed us how a real little boy would deal with the hand he was dealt, not some middle aged woman writing as a ten year old. 
 I personally loved the book so much I gave it to my brother as a high school graduation gift. If there is a book for anyone to read, where they can be inspired before jetting off into the world, it's this one. A beautiful life lesson.

 I read the book in one sitting, smiling, laughing, crying. It's one of those books... 
 This wonder-filled story is told through different point of views- each voice unique and spectacular - in such a way that gives the reader every side and angle of the story. It's like seeing every facet of a gem to really understand how valuable it really is. 
 Of course you think Auggie could never be ordinary- not until you hear him tell his own story. Via is too good to be true, but just wait and get to know the normal teenage human side of her. Miranda is the worst, disloyal friend...until you give her the chance to explain herself. Jack is worse that the meanest kid in Beecher... until you hear his side of the story. Then there's Summer, cool, awesome, unbelievable Summer and once you really know her...she's even more cooler beans! 
 This story simply proves that what seems to be extraordinary is really not and vice versa, that appearance is not what makes the difference...but our kindness and bravery. Beauty is not at all in the eye of the beholder- it's in the heart. Because real beauty can not be seen. It can only be felt.","Mon Sep 22 22:47:03 -0700 2014","Sun Nov 27 19:05:02 -0800 2016","Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 -0800 2016",2,0,""

After years of surgeries and being terribly sick, Auggie is finally well enough to go to a public school. 
 I expected this book to be good - and it did not let me down. The story was so charming and gripping, I read it one sitting. It follows Auggie through his first year of school, told in the perspective of Auggie as well as his friends, his sister, and his sister's friends. It was a pleasant surprise, as I had expected it all to be in Auggie's point of view. Though Auggie is the one who's experienced growing up with the deformity and the surgeries, it's been hard on the people around him, as well. His sister was understandably upset for herself in the situation. She wanted to have attention and wanted to be her own person without the image of Auggie following her around. Auggie's friends were good to him but at times made mistakes and hurt him, like real humans do. 
 This book was very real. It pointed out truths about how people react to medical issues and things that aren't considered the norm. The characters had very real emotions and reactions, even if they weren't all kind.

 Summary: ""Wonder is a rare gem of a novel--beautifully written and populated by characters who linger in your memory and heart. August Pullman is a 10-year-old boy who likes Star Wars and Xbox, ordinary except for his jarring facial anomalies. Homeschooled all his life, August heads to public school for fifth grade and he is not the only one changed by the experience--something we learn about first-hand through the narratives of those who orbit his world. August's internal dialogue and interactions with students and family ring true, and though remarkably courageous he comes across as a sweet, funny boy who wants the same things others want: friendship, understanding, and the freedom to be himself. ""It is only with one's heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye."" From The Little Prince and R.J. Palacio's remarkable novel, Wonder."" 
 I started off with a concern. You see, I had recommended this title to some middle school teachers. But it was about a boy in fifth grade. Uh oh, had I recommended a novel that was too young? I was pleasantly surprised to find that the reading level varied by narrator. Different people in Auggie's life narrate the action, so the reading levels change to match their tone. It varies all the way from a young Auggie starting fifth grade, to the commencement speech given by the principal at Graduation (written at a much higher grade level). 
 This book brought tears to my eyes on several occasions and gave me goosebumps. It is truly a beautiful piece of art. 
 One of my favorite quotes: ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.""

 Wonderful!! Total tear-jerker! I love it, all of it, how every character has something to contribute to the over-all story. This story moved me, really. I'm pretty emotional on almost everything but to this one, I was very very emotional. I just can't describe my feelings, why I was crying even though it's supposed to be a happy part. Ha! 
 Auggie, he's just so tough and all. I also love that it was about friendship and family overcoming the situation altogether. 
 Other Auggie's might have experience way too much than Auggie Pullman did but there's always an angel or maybe lots of angels looking out for them out there. 
 So to the author: Good Sir, I'm so proud of you.

 I can imagine this as a really good book to read for school. It has short chapters, which is good for portioning it into lessons, and it has good morals without being cheesy. 
 I didn't find it to be especially exciting or gripping or funny or anything, but it was cute and imaginative. I like books for kids that celebrate diversity and encourage kindness. I think this story can inspire kindness. And that's amazing.

Sometimes, when I can't get the words out to complain to a waiter about cold food or an empty drink, I think of my fear of seeming unkind as a weakness or failing. After reading Wonder, by R.J. Palacio, I have decided that I will always, always, always err on the side of kindness...cold food and all. 
 You see, this is an excellent book. It is about kindness. It is a book I think everyone should read. It is a book I gave to my seventh grader immediately after finishing and said, ""Please read this,"" and hoped and wished he would and not ignore it like he does with some of my suggestions. He did and he loved it too. We have had some great conversations about it since and I learned some things about him when we discussed the various characters. 
 Good books do that. They teach and inspire and warn and rebuke. I felt all of those things as I read about a nice young man with a facial deformity that made him an outcast at school and in life. I read about his fears and about his courage. I read about how people treated him. Once, in a moment of real confusion and questioning, I asked my mom what God could possibly have intended in his plan for people who suffered from debilitating mental illness. I will always remember her response. She said, ""I think, in large part, they suffer so he can judge how we treat them."" 
 Here is a quote from the book: ""If every person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God."" 
 There. I dare you not to love that quote. Auggie suffers so we can learn how to treat God's creations - deformed...beautiful and everything in between. Read this book and decide which of Wonder's character's you most resemble. They might be in middle school but I don't think any of us are too old to learn from Auggie. Read this book!

Auggie is a 10 year old who struggles with every day issues for a kid that age but what sets him apart is the fact that he has a 'hideous' face. That severe facial deformity catches attention from everyone no matter where he is or where he goes. This, of course, emphasizes all of the problems that arise because of it and in spite of it. 
 It's not your typical bully story and there is redemption in the end but it's not an easy read on the heart. It WILL make you want to love everyone around you a little harder so that they never second guess whether or not they are indeed loved. 
 August is a lovable kid and his fun personality is one that should be modeled by the kid in each and every one of us. He will win you over no matter how hard your heart is and you WILL agonize with him as he endures and perseveres through the ups-and-downs of growing up. In the process of it all, he learns invaluable lessons that should be taught to each and every one of us. 
 This is not an easy story to read. Your emotions will be all over the place and at times you won't really know what to feel. 
 The book is told mostly from Auggie's POV but it does switch to the POV of various other characters - which to me only adds to the validity and foundation of the book. Each POV offers a different take on certain situations so that you, the reader, get an honest account of all angles. 
 This story is sensitive and uplifting when you need it to be. To say that you will embrace life a little more when you finish it is an understatement. A true gem in a library full of like-minded works - and while written for those in the middle grades, is a book that can truly be appreciated by those of all ages.","Sat Mar 25 01:34:40 -0700 2017","Sun Mar 26 06:31:30 -0700 2017","Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 I was a bit worried about Wonder being a children's book. I've recently read some books geared toward teenagers and found I really couldn't relate to all that teenage angst. I feared it might be even worse with a children's book, but was pleasantly surprised. 
 August story, narrated by himself at first, is very interesting. Showing us the world through Auggie's eyes is a clever choice, since we have very little clues about August's appearance except that ""Whatever [we]'re thinking, it's probably worse."" Is it that I lack a child's imagination, but I think my idea of August was probably nicer than what is described in the rest of the book. 
 So I really liked August's narrative and was a bit taken aback when it switched to Via, his sister. I initially wasn't so sure I liked the change but The Via's chapters really add depth to the story. The role of the healthy sister in an Auggie-centered family certainly isn't an easy one and I really felt for her and wished the parents had divided their attention a tad more equally. 
 The book then switched to yet another narrator [ *me is looking in the book to find who that was]=], one of August's friend, Summer. Well let's just say I don't really remember much of Summer's story except that I don't think it added much to the story. Well at least it's someone close enough to the main character 
 Next in line, Jack. His input was justified, it was nice seing the other side of that element of the plot. Besides Jack is really easy to identify with, like most readers, he feels bad for August, he wouldn't bully him or be mean on purpose but he wouldn't have gone out of his way to befriend him either (cause he is afraid?). 
 Justin... Well unfortunately Justin seemed to be typing with a broken keyboard. Please can we raise some money so he can buy a keyboard with a working shift key? The authors tried to give each character it's own voice which went quite well until Justin's account. This change of style is too much ""in your face"" and makes that part a bit tedious. And much like Summer he didn't add much to the story. 
 Let's just not go over each different character that comes after, the point is just that the multiple narrators were a nice idea but it was taken just a bit too far. 
 Anyway this is just a very minor flaw. R.J. Palacio writes very skillfully about what it is to be normal (or not), how that notion is quite overrated and makes people act stupid sometime. But more importantly, and I think that's a great message that ""sometimes you don't have to mean to hurt someone to hurt someone"". 
 The last chapters are very inspirational (although a bit sugar coated) and is where you will find one of my favorite quote from the book: ""One should be kinder than needed. Why I love that line, that concept, is that it reminds me that we carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness."" 
 I just wish the ending had stayed in line with that quote... because giving an award to Auggie was nice, but I feel giving it to Jack would have been just. Jack was the one who made the choice of kindness, and wouldn't praising August for something he'd done be much more rewarding?","Fri Aug 22 14:48:33 -0700 2014","Sun Sep 21 05:00:09 -0700 2014","Sat Aug 23 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Fri Aug 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"True"

Really, in the end, the biggest annoyance for me was the use of song lyrics (I really just don't like it when authors assert their musical taste in books, and also I really, really, really hate the song ""Wonder""). No, wait. The biggest annoyance was actually Justin's chapter written entirely without capital letters. Or, no--maybe the part where Auggie and Jack Will are IM-ing each other in horrible, horrible text speak. Things like that are what made me give this book 3 stars instead of 4. Anyway, I certainly don't think this book is perfect, but I can see why there's a lot of love going around for it, and why it's been picked for a number of awards and book lists.

 We have August (Auggie) ten years old a regular kid who's funny, really sweet loves his Xbox, Star Wars and reading but there's one thing that stands him apart from every other ten year old his face is deformed, he has had twenty seven surgeries on his face since he was born but he's still left with facial deformities, his eyes are halfway down his face, he has a hole inside his mouth so he can only chew with his front teeth, he has no cheekbones so his face is all sucked in and people describe it as if he'd been in a fire and his face has melted and he has pretty much no ears but can still hear. 
 After being home schooled all his life his parents decide to enrol him in grade 5 at school but Auggie doesn't want to go because he knows the reactions he'll get, the same ones he's been getting all his life from both children who sometimes scream when they see his face and adults who should know better but move themselves and their kids away when the see him. 
 Auggie also wore an astronaut helmet two years straight so no one could see his face. 
 While at his school to meet the principal before school starts he's introduced to three kids Jack, Julian and Charlotte who were asked to come in on their holidays to show Auggie around, and of course like most people are taken aback at his appearance, school starts and Auggie is excited he sits next to Jack but Julian is a mean boy and makes remarks that Auggie knows are directed at him, lunchtime comes and Auggie is sitting all alone while everyone is staring not wanting to get close in case they could somehow catch something off him because of his face which later becomes known as the Plague where everyone goes out of their way not to touch him, a girl called Summer sits down with him after initially feeling sorry for him but soon finds herself enjoying his company and becoming friends. 
 Anyone who decides to be friends with Auggie is ostracised thanks to Julian, him being in the popular clique. 
 One of the most emotional parts for me was Halloween, students were allowed to go to school in costume and at the last minute Auggie ran out of time to put his costume on so he put on his Bleeding Scream costume from the previous year and because he had a mask on no one recognized him and he overheard someone who he thought was a friend calling him names, so being all upset he pretended he was sick so he could go home,. 
 Just the anguish he went through wondering why he couldn't have a normal face like everybody else, even going camping on a school trip and he gets picked on by a bunch of kids from another school after he's been having such a good time. 
 The end I loved and I was crying tears of happiness for an ending that was perfect in my opinion and for one of the lines his Mum says to him""Thank you Auggie, for everything you've given us, for coming into our lives, for being you"" (wow I started crying just typing that). 
 For all those people who have ever been bullied and who judge people on the way they look and yes I'm big enough to admit I've done it, but this book has made me sit and think for those people who have some kind of deformity they are still people too they just look a little different to you and I. 
 I can't say enough about this book, the writing was flawless and heartfelt and the author is amazing for being able to get into that mindset and believing in a character that just seemed so incredibly real and brave and courageous. 
 So please read this book it's fantastic and as Auggie would say 'cool beans'.","Fri Feb 17 03:35:51 -0800 2012","Sun Feb 19 17:16:47 -0800 2012","Sun Feb 19 17:16:47 -0800 2012","Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 -0800 2012",5,0,""

 August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school--until now. He's about to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances? 
 This book was amazing. It was a kid book, yes, but was better then some Young Adult books I've read. I have a horrible habit of judging books because they're written for kids. I went into this book thinking,""it's just a kids book. I'll try to get through it as fast as I can."" Boy, was I wrong. From the minute I picked it up, I was unable to put it down. It got to where I was up at three a.m finishing it. 
 Auggie Pullman was born with a facial deformity. He's never went to a real school. Now he can. As he start school at Beecher Prep, he gets bullied and makes new friends, but still gets the disgusted stares from classmates as he walks through the halls. Does Auggie really have what it takes to go to school facing the rude comments? 
 August was an extraordinary character. It was very nice being able to see how he handles things. I actually was shocked with how dealt with rude comments and how he would joke about the way he was born. He was an amazing character. 
 Jack Will and Summer were Auggie's two main friends. They were both sweet and always nice to Auggie. They treated him like a normal kid. Summer sat with him at lunch and Jack did end up doing that also. And Jack was in his homeroom and most of his classes so they quickly became friends. 
 Julian was a complete jerk. He was this evil twisted boy who found pleasure in making fun of August. He was always leaving rude notes in his locker, and making disgusted looks at him from across the room. He was in the ""popular"" crowd (if you can be popular in fifth grade.) so everyone liked him. 
 Olivia, ninth grader Augusts sister, was caring to August. She also treated him normal. She knew he was different. She just didn't act rude about it. She was a good character. But, at times, she made me disappointed and upset. 
 This story has eight parts, 1. Auggie, 2. Olivia, 3. Summer, 4. Jack, 5. Justin, Olivia's Boyfriend, 6. Auggie, 7. Miranda, Olivia's old friend, 8. Auggie. 
 My favorite POV, other then Auggie's, was Jack's. I also loved Summer's and Miranda's. I gave this book five stars and wish I could give it more. This book is a must read.

 What a wonder of a book! 
 First sentence: I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. 
 August (Auggie) is 10-year-old born with a cranio-facial abnormality that, in spite of who he is inside, makes him stand out in a crowd. 
 This is the story of his first year in school, told in the first person through various viewpoints - Auggie, his sister Olivia(Via), her boyfriend Justin, her friend Miranda, and Auggie's friends Jack and Summer. 
 I love how this story is told in a realistic, ""that's just the way it is"" fashion - even Via, who is a teenager, pretty much rolls with the fact that most of the attention goes to Auggie - with all of the surgeries that he has had, that's just to be expected. She's always stuck up for him, and never, until this first year of her going to a new high school, felt at all ashamed of his appearance. 
 Auggie? Well, he's just a great kid - a Star Wars fan, an XBox-playing, joke-making, pretty smart little dude who loves his family and their dog Daisy, bought off of a homeless guy for $20 by Auggie's father. He has a loving and imperfect family, he doesn't feel sorry for himself (much), and seeing the world through his eyes made this reader even more grateful and appreciative. 
 Of course we run into the casually (and not so casually) cruel kids and adults, but Auggie, who wasn't too keen on the idea of going to school, manages to make some friends, and, if he doesn't blend in, at least people get used to him. Then a boy he thought was his friend seems to turn against him, and we all feel the hurt. Another boy starts a bullying campaign, and here is where we see Auggie's true strength come to the fore. His friendships are tested, and his friends make the reader proud. 
 At the end of this book, and throughout the last pages, I was wiping away tears, the kind of tears inspired by hope and a touch of the happy. 
 This book is geared to middle readers (8-12 years old), but is definitely one that everyone should read. Teachers, homeschoolers, parents, and even adults - pick this one up - you will love it as much as I did. 
 And you will LOVE Auggie! This one will definitely be showing up on my ""Best of"" list for 2012; it's a winner all around. 
 QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy): 
 Auggie: I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kid run away screaming in playgrounds. 
 Auggie: I think it's like the Cheese Touch in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"". The kids in that story were afraid they'd catch the cooties if they touched the old moldy cheese on the basketball court. At Beecher Prep, I'm the old moldy cheese. 
 Summer: So I just went over and sat with him. Not a biggie. I wish people would stop trying to turn it into something major. 
 He's just a kid. The weirdest-looking kid I've ever seen, yes. But just a kid.

 ""Sometimes you don't have to mean to hurt someone to hurt someone."" 
 My Summary: 
 August (Auggie) Pullman has wanted nothing but to be normal but with a facial deformity that causes everyone to stare at him everywhere he goes, ordinary is out of the question. 
 He's never been in a mainstream school and would never want to go until his parents tell him otherwise. 
 Being the new kid in school is challenge enough but with his extraordinary face, will he be able to show them that despite his face his just like everybody else? 
 My Thoughts:> 
 I've seen this book a year ago and I've always been interested in reading it for 2 reasons: First, I like topics regarding anomalies, I know it's weird but it's just really fascinating for me. Second, The cover really attracted me and I like kids. Okay, so that's like 3 reasons. Ooopppsss. But I always end up buying other books first until recently I bought it. It's a life changer guys. :-) 
 From the first chapter, I was already hooked. When Auggie explained that he wasn't ordinary, I felt my heart pang. I could just feel how much he wanted to be ordinary but he just can't. His words, feelings, stories, actions are just all inspiring really. 
 It's not just Auggie's point of view the book tackes but also the people closest to Auggie. With these different point of views, I was able to understand how others see him. My favorite has to be Via's (his older sister) because I can relate to her somehow. I could see how much she really loves him. But it's not just her love but Auggie's whole family's love for him that's overflowing which is why I think he's able to give love to others too. 
 Via isn't perfect. She makes mistakes too. But nevertheless, you could never deny the fact that she will always love Auggie no matter what. In a way, I feel sad for Via cause all the attention always goes to Auggie and it seems that she has to fend for herself. I would just suddenly feel the urge to cry when I read her POV. (This is a feat for me cause I'm not a cryer.) She's a very strong woman and I'm glad she has... *wink* and her Grandma. 
 Auggie's parents are just the loveliest people ever. All of Via and Auggie's friends like to go to their house because they can feel the love. It's in the air. I love households like that. My sisters, my mom and I are really close and I can relate to this overflowing love that their parent's give them cause I'm a full tank as well. 
 In his new school, he starts making friends. Summer is just this cute little girl who befriends Auggie. She's amazing. At such a young age, I could say that she'll grow up to be this wonderful & beautiful human being. 
 Jack Will. He was nice to Auggie and they started talking all the time which lead to them being best friends. Something happens that broke my heart into a kajillion pieces... but then he tells his part of the story that seemed to mend my broken heart. 
 Mr Browne. He's this genius of an English teacher. Love him and his precepts! He speaks the truth. You guys will love him too! 
 Seriously, guys, this is the book I recommend everyone to read. I mean EVERY single human being in the world. The heart of this book is for us to be kind. You might say you already know that. It's pretty obvious. But the important thing in this book is that we are reminded of it. There are so many things happening in our lives that we simply forget the most important thing... Who we are--- what kind of people we are. 
 ""When given the choice between being right or being kind. Choose kind."" 
 At the end of the day, how you treat people is what really matters. The genre of Childrens might scare you off but give this book a chance. This is a wonderful book and yes, you should read this. Auggie has definitely left imprints on my heart. The ending of this book is just heart warming so prepare to have tissues when you read this! 
 Highly recommended! 
 Happy Reading!!!","Wed May 14 08:50:30 -0700 2014","Thu Sep 11 05:25:37 -0700 2014","","",1,0,""

 Wonder is told from a variety of first person perspectives, starting with August himself. Things don't seem all that bad from his point of view and as you read on you get the sense that he has really come to terms with how he looks and what people think of him. I was thinking everyone seems far too kind to be real but that is only how he sees it. 
 It's only when you get to his sister Via's narrative that you are told what August looks like and get a real sense of the reactions towards him. It seems odd that August's condition isn't named and Via goes so far to say it doesn't even have a name. I wonder if this is to deter younger readings from googling images? August does in fact have Treacher Collins Syndrome, in which the facial bones fail to develop fully in the womb. This causes a number of problems including difficulty with breathing, eating and even hearing as the inner ear is made up of tiny bones. However mentally, people with TCS are just like anyone else. 
 The story is also told from the point of view of August's friends, Summer and Jack, and Via's friend Miranda and boyfriend Justin. I get that Justin was used as an outside perspective but his section is told in lower case and without speech marks which made it hard to follow. It makes the point that August's family don't judge on appearances but I really don't see the point in the change of style. Justin suffers from a tic and the writing style makes you think he may have learning difficulties but does this not go against the whole point of the book, do not judge people on things outside of their control? 
 The alternating narrators are otherwise used to great effect. It is all about perspectives and goes to show what we display on the outside is not always what's going on inside our heads. Personally, I would have liked one of the parents' perspective but there does seem an unwritten rule in young adult that anyone over 20 doesn't get a featured role. Also all the narrators are very sympathetic characters, it would have been interesting to know what was going on in Julian's head. 
 I was glad that Palacio included the passage where Jack's little brother is scared of August. When I think back on all the things I was scared of when I was little, disfigured faces were high up on the list. Not in a malicious way or even a learned fear, it is something that is instinctive. The first time I watched The Goonies, Sloth terrified me, and he turns out to be one of the good guys. It is of course awful for August that he is feared, but it is one of the most real parts of the story. 
 There are some really moving parts but I think the bullying is watered down a little to what it would be in reality. Kids can be cruel but even the bully character, Julian, seems sanitised. Either they seem too mature for their age or they are not old enough to have developed the bitchiness that comes with hormones and peer pressure. The ending was too unbelievable for me but works as a moral message.","Sat Feb 25 02:02:28 -0800 2012","Sun Feb 26 03:25:20 -0800 2012","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2012",3,0,""

August is a boy born with severe facial deformities and finally has the opportunity to attend school. He's accepted into an exclusive private school in NYC, but not everyone is thrilled he's been admitted. Even August isn't sure attending fifth grade is such a good idea. To say what he endures is horrific is an understatement. Kids stare at him, whisper in front of him, and are terrified of him. August loves Halloween because it's the only time he can ""fit in."" Heartbreaking. But not all is bad in his life. He has loving parents, a sister who cherishes him, and a few true friends. Still, to read this story, you'll see life through completely different eyes and wonder how often people are judged first and foremost by appearance. I dare you not to fall in love with Auggie. I did.

Yes, it's designed for middle schoolers, but anybody 10 years and up would appreciate this book. R.L. Palacio, the author, writes with just the right balance of humor and pathos, making each character both flawed and sympathetic. She understands kids -- how they think, how they talk, how they have the capacity to be both horribly mean and incredibly brave and kind. I recognize these characters from my childhood, my children, my grandchildren and my years of teaching. The book is so authentic. The short chapters and shifting narrative make this a quick, easy read. It's a feel-good book with a great message, and the ending is a tearjerker that will leave a sweet, sweet feeling in your heart for a long time.","Tue Oct 25 14:47:56 -0700 2016","Sat Oct 29 09:00:30 -0700 2016","Sat Oct 29 09:00:30 -0700 2016","Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

 Wonder is the story of August Pullman. Entering fifth grade is scary. Entering fifth grade after years of being homeschooled is even scarier. But entering fifth grade after years of being homeschooled because you were born looking differently from others is the scariest. In this story, we are taken through Auggie's first year at school. Throughout, we learn why Auggie looks the way he does. We learn the struggles of his daily life, along with his sisters & her boyfriends, and even a couple of his new friends at school. 
 What I enjoyed most about the book was that it did not hold back. It showed the inner ugliness of some people in this world, but it did not fail to show the complete and utter kindness of others too. Auggie is my favorite character in this book for so many reasons. The fact that he is loving, understanding, resilient, and absolutely hysterical are only just a few. This book made me laugh, made me cry and at times, made my blood boil. 
 All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this story. While this book is certainly geared towards late elementary, middle school, and high schoolers..do not count out YA or adults. It can teach everyone a lesson on being kind because lets face it; you do not only have to be young to be taught kindness.","Sun Feb 26 05:18:29 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 26 05:20:39 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 26 05:20:39 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 26 05:20:25 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 I picked up Wonder when I found out it was going to be adapted as a movie this fall. Yes, I'm one of those people who only reads a book once it's going to be a film, but whatever. I always like giving the book a chance before I see the movie, and I'm sure many of you can relate. Anyway, I started this book on a whim and was pleasantly surprised by it. 
 Much of the book feels as though it were narrated by children, and that's because it is. Auggie is only in fifth grade, and the writing style in his chapters reflects that really well. Auggie cares about the things kids his age care about: Star Wars, friends, school, and his family. There's a sweet naivete to his narration, and yet the story is still strikingly profound at points. I was thoroughly impressed by Palacio's ability to weave childhood innocence into a complex understanding of human nature. Also, Wonder is by no means a children's book. That is to say, children can read and enjoy it, but so can adults and readers of all ages. 
 The novel doesn't just include Auggie's POV. Part two of the novel is narrated by Auggie's older sister, Via, who has just started high school. She gives an interesting perspective from the ""other"" child's point of view. The third and fourth parts are told by Summer and Jack, two of the students he attends school with. Despite the young narrators, the actions and opinions of adults play a big role in the story. It was interesting to view parents through the eyes of their children, and I was impressed by Palacio's ability to show multiple points of view throughout his story. 
 I won't lie. Not much actually happens in Wonder. There's no big climax, no life-or-death situations. The story mostly revolves around Auggie and his friends and family as they make their way through everyday life. At points, I kind of wished for a little more action, but I also understand why Palacio weaved the story this way. Every day requires bravery for these characters and plenty of people in the world, and Palacio really taps into that ordinary strength. 
 Overall, Wonder was definitely an interesting break from the typical novels I read. It's lighthearted and amusing, and you'll definitely walk away from it feeling as though the world might not be such a bad place after all.","Fri Apr 21 13:32:44 -0700 2017","Wed Apr 26 09:41:57 -0700 2017","Wed Apr 26 09:41:58 -0700 2017","Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 -0700 2017",1,0,"False"

 And that, right there, sums up my reaction to this book for me. It is, in short, beautiful. August, who was born with a major facial deformity, must face the real world as he begins mainstream 5th grade. His family needs almost as much support facing this new adventure as he does. But August thrives, changing everyone around him.

 I used to work with youth, and in particular special needs youth. One particular moment always comes back to me, and made this book hit especially close to home. There was a young girl who was just going into the sixth grade that has Asberger's. We had a sleepover weekend and she was put into a group of ""normal"" girls that she had never met before. At first, I will fully admit, I thought she was just as annoying as everyone else. She talked at all the inappropriate times, she talked about weird things that no one else could understand, and she couldn't form any emotional attachments to any of the other girls. 
 But she was just a little girl. 
 About half way through the weekend, she had a massive breakdown. She came bawling to me saying, ""People think that I can't tell that I'm weird, but I know I am. I know I'm not normal. I can't help it. Everyone is always looking at me funny and I hate it. I can't help it. I really can't help it. They think I can't tell, but I know they're staring."" I seriously think those words will haunt me for the rest of my life.

A genetic malady has grossly deformed his face. The novel is an expose about the capability of human beings to be cruel or kind, and the difference between inner and outer beauty. 
 Auggie has a rough time at the start. Only a few brave students have the guts to talk to him. The novel takes place over a school year. Things happen but this is not a book with much of a plot. The novel is more about a state change with the students surrounding Auggie. 
 Palacio says she was inspired to write the novel because she turned to see a young child sitting on a bench eating ice cream who was deformed like Auggie. She pulled her daughter away and then thought back on her actions. That night she began writing Wonder. A scene in the novel reenacts her own actions but seen from Auggie's POV. 
 It's first person, limited POV and Palacio wisely moves it to different people from one chapter to the next. The first third of the book was Auggie's POV only and I think the novel would have failed had she not had other narrators. 
 There's no scintillating action. The end is somewhat predictable. There are some memorable lines, like ""Everyone at one time in their life should receive a standing ovation."" But the book has touched many people because we all, I suspect, to a lesser extent on the outside, but perhaps to the same extent on the inside, have had to deal with other's opinions of ourselves. 
 Wonder gives us a very upbeat view of human nature: that most of us eventually gravitate to kindness instead of cruelty. Auggie is the catalyst for people to discover the kind part of themselves. Finally, the kids grow to like Auggie not because it's cool, or it looks meritorious to do so. They do because Auggie is as beautiful and kind on the inside, as he is unattractive on the outside. Auggie is a one of-a-kind, a wonder.","Tue Jun 07 09:54:10 -0700 2016","Sun Jun 19 23:34:38 -0700 2016","Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Tue Jun 07 00:00:00 -0700 2016",12,0,""

 This is the kind of story that should be read by everyone, from children to adults because it teaches many valuable lessons, and most importantly it shows us what it's like to be in someone else's shoes. 
 The storyoif Auggie is different because he's simply different, we witness his experience in life and also the experience of the people around him, from family to school mates. So we got to read the story from different POV, the chapters are also very short and keep changing between characters which made this easy and fun to read. 
 This story was packed with so many emotions, I nearly cried at some parts and laughed at others, 
 The writing was beautiful and fun, i finished this so fast and could not put it down, i never got bored and always wanted to have more. I rarely enjoy realistic stories but this one is brilliant and fun.

 I feel like someone squeezed my heart so much, because this book carries an important lesson that everyone needs to learn and master. It is something I try to overcome everyday and hope to live up to. 
 This may be labeled as a middle grade book, which is true about most of its protagonists. But it is certainly for adults as well, especially for those who have lost hope in the world.

 Wonder is the first novel by book cover designer and artistic director R. J. Palacio. It has been all the rave on book blogs and recommendation sites since its publication last year so naturally it has been on my TBR (To Be Read) list for a while. 
 The book tells the story of August Pullman who, with a stroke of bad genetic luck, was born with a rare disease that seriously deforms his face. Of course, people treat him differently because of that. His loving parents and older sister, however, have showered little Auggie with love and have given him the childhood that most children his age could only dream of. He has grown into an extraordinary young man. If only he lived in a society that didn't judge a book by its cover... 
 It's time now for August to leave the comforts of home and go to school with ""regular kids."" Middle school , of all places! Will little Auggie be able to survive? How will his classmates treat him? 
 The author expertly chronicles August's first year in middle school through the eyes of August himself and those closest to him. There are definitely parts of the novel that will pull at the reader's heart-strings. By the end, readers will marvel at August's bravery and, perhaps, learn to appreciate the normalcy in their own lives. 
 Verdict: Loved, loved, loved this book! Highly recommended!","Sun Jan 27 17:35:47 -0800 2013","Mon Feb 11 15:42:06 -0800 2013","Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

 This book is 5 stars. I think that every fifth and sixth grader should read this book, and I hope that my future students do. Through massive character development all around, this book shows what kindness is. It shows bravery and courage, standing up for yourself and your friends. The values taught in this story are irreplaceable. 
 The book takes a disorder and, unlike other modern children's/YA lit, writes about what the character goes through. Palacio doesn't use Auggie's face as a means to something else. 
 Wonder also offers a great look at WHY kids do the things that they do...it is rarely for no reason, and is always related to some external problem that they are experiencing on their own. Miranda is not simply a bad friend to Via because she just wants to be, there is something deeper. Summer isn't just a beautiful, bi-racial girl. She has a story. While Auggie is the central character in this book, each one is well-developed and grows throughout the story. 
 This book, to me, is a reminder of why I want to teach middle school. Middle schoolers are going through a hectic, confusing time. But they are good kids. Each one of them is going through something so different, it is so hard to blame them for their actions in school. I have seen the power of kindness growing up in public school and now in my own classrooms, and things like this do happen. Kids come together. It is truly amazing and it's one of the reasons I want to be a teacher one day. I have so much faith in those kids.","Fri Oct 14 08:47:10 -0700 2016","Sat Apr 01 11:02:11 -0700 2017","Sat Apr 01 11:02:11 -0700 2017","Thu Mar 30 14:36:29 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 This book has been sitting on my shelf for many months and now that I finally picked it up, I wonder why I haven't done it before. 
 ""Wonder"" was SO refreshing and unique. The concept and the characters are very interesting and I love how the story is told from so many different prospectives (none of which was uninteresting or irrelevant) that help you get a clear idea of the sequence of events. 
 The author also does a great job in managing to make the reader love August and care for him. He's sweet, fun, kind and smart at the same time. Probably one of the most likable characters I've ever read about. 
 This novel also teaches a moral lesson or two, which is always nice. 
 ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."" 
 This might come out corny, but I am a huge supporter of spreading positive messages about being nice to each other, like this precept, and seeing that in books just makes me very happy. 
 Surprisingly, I really enjoyed reading from a 10 year old's POV. I'm new to the middle-grade genre and this was a great start. I'm very amused. 
 I highly suggest this because I think it's something everyone would enjoy, whether they're 12 or 70.","Thu Sep 25 07:09:47 -0700 2014","Thu Jan 14 03:12:29 -0800 2016","Mon Apr 27 19:10:47 -0700 2015","Fri Apr 24 00:00:00 -0700 2015",2,0,""

 Wow, just wow. I did not expect this book to have this much of an impact on me. But that's what I love about it. I love to read those books where after finishing, you're still thinking about it. And that's what R.J Palacio's book 'Wonder' did to me. 
 'Wonder' is a story that starts off by being told by fifth grader August Pullman who's starting school again. He was born with a face deformation and believes that he'll never fit in at his new school. This is such a touching and emotional story where we get to see the vulnerability that's known to follow August around through his life. 
 But that's not it, we also get to hear from several other voices in this story. Via, augusts sister, shares her feelings and actions. It's like a whole different side of the story and even though Via is lucky enough to not have been born with the same medical issues as her brother, she too has many problems and difficulties going on in her life. Then there's also Some of Augusts friends like Summer and Jack Will too. 
 We even get to hear from some others that don't even play a really main role in the story, like Via's friend Miranda and Via's boyfriend Justin. Even though these characters don't play huge roles in the book, their point of view still leaves a huge impact on you. 
 This is a book where I'm hungry to find out more and there's never a dull moment. It has made my fully appreciate my life and how fortunate I am today. 
 ""So doesn't that make the world a giant lottery then? You purchase a ticket when you're born. And it's all just a random whether you get a good ticket or a bad ticket. it's all just luck. 
 Author R.J Palacio has definitely opened our eyes around some issues like bullying and has taught us about living life to its fullest, and being grateful with what you have. But above all, she's taught us how important a single word is: kindness. To be kinder than is necessary. 
 And lastly, ""everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world.""","Sun Jun 15 07:49:19 -0700 2014","Sat Jul 05 16:08:29 -0700 2014","Thu Jul 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Thu Jul 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 That's the basic setting of Wonder, a book that hits all the right emotional notes while remaining realistic about the cruelty and kindness of young children and the adults that surround them. It's a book that has a message while also having a good, coherent, and worthwhile story. 
 If I have any complaint, it's that it ties itself together a little too easily and maybe shouldn't have, but considering the age group this is geared toward, I can let that slide.

Funny, touching, heart-breaking, sincere, moving, what other excellent-review-type-words can I put in here? This is a must-read.

I can't say enough good things about it. 
 August was born with a not one, but two genetic abnormalities that caused his face to be severely deformed. After a ton of surgeries he still claims that he doesn't look anything near ""normal"" and people still stop and stare when seeing him for the first time. Partly because of all of the surgeries and partly to protect him from the not-so-nice world, August's parents have homeschooled him for the first years of his life. Now, August (Auggie) is going to middle school, the private Beecher Prep, close to his home in Manhattan. This is a coming of age story and yet so much more than that. Auggie is such a brave dude, but he is also human and this makes the story so real that it is impossible not to cry and laugh thoughout the book. 
 The story is told from a few different points of view: Auggie's, his sister Via's, Via's boyfriend's, Via's former best friend's and the POVs of a couple of Auggie's new friends from Beecher. Each one of these characters is written so well, I wished that there could be a whole book written from each of their points of view. 
 There are many characters to despise, Ximena and Julian, for example, but other than those toadstools, is very easy to be sympathetic to each of the other characters, even when they do things that make one cringe.

He has been homeschooled for his whole life until he started grade 5 where his parents decided whether to send him to public school. This book is told in one year (his 5th grade year) and told in more than one perspective. 
 I enjoyed this book very much and I loved how the story line played out. Auggie is a sweet little boy despite his facial deformity and gets bullied quite a lot because of it. Sometimes he's ashamed and sometimes he's not and this story basically shows the readers how one person can overcome something so big, something that causes other people to look at you in a different way. 
 Auggie is mature for a fifth grader and the fact that some of the students (the other characters) look past his deformity and focus more on his personality makes me wish that it would happen in real life. Nowadays, people don't really care about personalities, they focus more on looks and I think this middle grade novel really teaches a lesson! Especially with students at this age, it's great to teach them lessons like this at a younger age.

Palacio -- a middle grade novel about a young boy, Auggie Pullman, with a rare genetic facial deformity and his first year in middle school -- and spoiler alert -- it all turns out okay. There are cool inspirational quotes along the way such as ""You're gonna reach the sky..Fly... Beautiful child,"" from the Eurythmics ""Beautiful Child."" Different characters struggle with his deformity -- his own, his sister's, his best friend's -- and except for a handful of stock bullying bad kids -- they all turn out to be good, kind kids and see past what is obvious -- and to the inner self of Auggie. I envied his parents -- hard-working, caring, decent people -- a mother who said all the right things. At the end, his class gives him a standing ovation at the graduation ceremonies. Auggie soars. I loved this novel. I cried. I cheered. It's a novel to read with your kids. But I could never write it -- never, ever. 
 I think to write a happy novel -- one with characters that are essentially good people with decent values--one had to live a life filled with people who are essentially good. For the most part, I didn't have those kind of people in my life growing up except for my Pop. He was a good father, a good man, too often overwhelmed with being a single parent. His words of wisdom were blunt: the way you make your bed is the way you'll sleep in it. I love him still for trying. 
 I don't know if R. J. Palacio had a happy life or not -- but I know that mine was broken. One way I've put it back it back together is writing. Even so, the pieces are never as happy as WONDER. But I'm thankful there are writers like her that can write 'happy' -- a wonder to me. Caroline

 ""My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probable worse."" 
 Just a pinch of it, this is a story of a 10 year old boy who had an inborn genetic conflict that affected his face. Because of that, people looked at him differently. He was frequently judged and misunderstood. So damn hard for a boy who had no idea that he'll be born that way! No one likes what happened. It was inevitable, so he lived most of his life thinking low of himself because people don't even want to look at him, talk to him, and touch him. Much worse is that they don't even want to go anywhere near him. On the bright side, he has his family who loves him wholeheartedly for the way he is. 
 ""She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can't change my face."" 
 Auggie isn't ordinary. He is special despite the way people see him, which made me think that we limit our minds on what the media and the modern environment tell us (like the standard of beauty, what is normal or different and what is acceptable or not). We judge based on our own standards and perceptions while we exclude God's other creations behind. 
 ""I thought I was used to those kinds of stares by now, but I guess I wasn't."" 
 It seems very difficult to be in August's shoes. All he wanted was to be accepted. It's hard to live every day when people call you names and look at you like you are a carrier of an epidemic. Well, he swallowed being mistreated for years. That's how strong Auggie is. Notwithstanding, Auggie is an enjoyable character. He is funny, intelligent, kind, and HE IS A NORMAL 10 YEAR OLD BOY. It's just that he is judged without knowing the real him. He's is viewed narrowly based on his outer appearance. 
 As I read, I was shocked that the POV changed from most of the characters of the story. Every person shed a light on August's life. This is good because I was able to know the perceptions of the other characters. It made me realize that everyone has his or her story. Everyone is different from each other. Everyone has a battle to face. Everyone has sacrifices to make. All people have their own burdens and feelings. We don't know each other's story, so why do we judge beforehand? 
 Indeed, this book is very inspiring, light and uplifting. Some parts made me cry (while I was riding a bus to school), some melted my heart, and some made me laugh. It can definitely move people of every age. This heartwarming story teaches a lot of values that are necessary in life that will let you look at things in a different light. It is an eye opener for us to choose being good ALL THE TIME to ALL PEOPLE. We must not let differences be hindrances. Instead, we must appreciate and embrace such. This has the power to change readers. 
 "" 'Shall we make a new rule of life... always try to be a little kinder than necessary?' "" 
 Thank you also R.J. Palacio for writing this book and for inspiring a lot of people including me. Well, especially for all of the wonders out there who are experiencing this. You are all great! :-) 
 Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world.

 August has trouble at school so Palacio gives him loving parents. She nails the 'we need balance' thing perfectly. he has a sister who is very protective of him.But August's life is hard and Palacio introduces a spunky hero. 
 Told from six points of view, Wonder is an amazing novel, not one to miss. 
 It has a lot of dialogue but it makes the reader enter the world. 
 When Daisy dies, its got to be the saddest part in the book, besides Jack going behind Augusts back on Halloween and talking badly about him to Juian, the boy who was very rude to August. 
 Recommended to: Anyone who feels their life is unfair, to people who enjoy books filled with sadness but potent happiness and the power of friends. 
 *Wonder Rules* 
 Key Points: 
 -Justin is mean to August. 
 -If you touch August, you have the Plague. 
 -Julian is cool.(Not.) 
 -Summer is August's friend. 
 -Jack punches Julian because he asks the teacher to be Jacks partner because Jacks partner for the science fair is August.

Simply written, but the heart behind the writing was felt in every word. I giggled, I growled, I bawled.

RJ Palacio got the whole middle-school hierarchy right, and I can visualize the characters and the school. It's a feel-good story with lots of detail, greatly written and well thought out. One of my favorites. 
 Also, there is another Wonder story on iBooks called The Julian Chapter. It's about Julian's point of view and the story on how everything turned out in the end (this is me trying to be vague) and it's a really nice addition to Wonder.","Mon Jun 30 12:35:51 -0700 2014","Fri Jan 06 18:20:31 -0800 2017","","",0,0,"False"

I meant to read it during the school year, while all my students were singing its praises and the middle school in our district was even reading it as a 1 book, 1 school project. Yet, I didn't. I read it right after school ended. I would highly suggest keeping a tissue box nearby. There are some amazing moments in this book and the book is from several points of view, giving insight into how Auggie, his older sister, and a few other characters felt throughout the book's events. I cannot imagine what it would feel like to be as brave as Auggie as he attends middle school, makes friends, is stared at constantly and even is bullied. It's an amazing story about a supportive family, a wonderful yet strange looking boy, and the friends that make him feel like he is more than just a weird face to look at.

 That is the thing I like the most about reading. That it makes us feel things, it makes you WONDER about the crucial questions in life. And in this instance, of what kind of person we have become?

In fact, his appearance is so shocking, that his mother has been protecting him his whole life from the reactions of the outside world. His name is Auggie, and he has been homeschooled up until the fifth grade, but is about to embark on his first year at school. On his first day visiting his new school, he learns that several students have been assigned to help him navigate this new world. The story tells about, not only Auggie's adjustments to his new school during his first year, but also how his classmates learn to adjust, and even to befriend someone who is so different, and thus initially frightening. 
 The book is told from Auggie's perspective, but also from the perspectives of those around him: his sister Via, her boyfriend Justin, Auggie's friend Jack and so on. The shifting perspectives didn't bother me a bit, because it really added to the narrative to see how those around Auggie were both constantly aware of him, and totally involved in their own universes. All of the characters are likeable, and I think that Palacio does an excellent job of capturing a variety of honest and human behaviors and emotions. She also doesn't place Auggie on a pedestal; he has faults, just like everyone else. 
 I definitely cried while reading Wonder, and laughed. I thought it was a wonderful book about friendship, and growth, and tolerance. Highly recommended.","Thu Nov 08 20:27:36 -0800 2012","Thu Nov 08 20:28:07 -0800 2012","Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

 This book is awesome. Made me teary eyed a couple of times, and I can swear, there were parts where fats tears were rolling down my cheeks. 
 Wonder is heart-touching and thought provoking. A tearjerker one second than humorous the next. Wonder is simple but awe-inspiring and one of my best reads so far for 2015. 
 August Pullman, a boy too horrible too be described by words. He knows it for a fact. He knows people are scared of him, and people mock him left and right. But what is amazing is how he deals with life. Despite being burdened by a face that is so gruesome and his lack of ears (i'm not trying to be mean), August remains to be a person so beautiful that it radiates through. 
 Wonder told in a little bit of everyone's perspective. Chapters are short. For an easy read, this book does pack an emotional punch. Brimming with values, it is a must read for every child and adult alike. 
 August Pullman, I love you. I feel as if you changed my life a little too. I also have a feeling I will not forget you as you have touched my <3. :)","Tue Jan 01 11:18:46 -0800 2013","Tue May 05 01:09:10 -0700 2015","Sun May 03 13:38:32 -0700 2015","Tue Apr 28 00:00:00 -0700 2015",2,0,"False"

 10-year-old August Pullman is a sweet boy. He has a loving family and a dog who adores him named Daisy. But August's world is a small one. Born with severe facial deformities he is used to being gasped at when in public places. Small children point at him and adults quickly scurry away acting as thought there was some emergency ""to do: they had forgotten about. Because of all of this, August has been home schooled. 
 Until now. 
 Now as August is about to enter 5th grade his parents think that maybe trying a regular school would be a good idea. August is not so sure but agrees to give it a try under the safety net that if he wants to quit he can. As anticipated, most of Augie's classmates can not get past his face. Augie is called names and noted are left in his locker. One boy Jack, seems to be a friend, and a girl named Summer (who likes that both of their names are seasons...) but one can never be too sure because peer pressure to agree with everyone else is a strong force in 5th grade. 
 In an age where bullying amongst kids is strong, can Augie survive the tests and the lessons of being the bigger person? 
 Why did I want to read this book? WONDER has been on my """"I want to read!"" list since last year. In fact, it was on track to be my first read of 2012 and then at the last second I decided on another book and WONDER was set aside. Now, October being National Bully Prevention month, I thought I would give it a try to I downloaded it from audible.com to listen to. 
 Wonder is just that. A wonder. Narrated in the beginning by August, he tells of his childhood and the start of this school year. You do not get a clear idea of what his deformities exactly are - August mainly focuses on the reaction of the people around when they see him. It's actually heart breaking to hear it from his perspective...

Therefore I had to pick up this book...and I didn't absolutely love it like everyone said I would #unpopularOpinion. 
 I liked this book, don't get me wrong I didn't hate it. However for me a 5 star book is an absolute favourite 10/10 would read again...which I just didn't get with this book. 
 So let's start from the beginning...in this book we follow a young boy called August (Auggie), he has some sort of congenital face deformity and for his entire life has been home schooled, until now. Now he is starting middle school along with every other child has age, however as we all know kids can be pretty cruel. We follow the story through his first year at public school and as well as seeing it from his point of view we also see it from the views of others around him and what they think about him. 
 This was a really emotional book, I'm sure at some point we've seen someone with some form of disfigurement and we have done exactly what is described in this book - looked out the corner of our eye then quickly looked away hoping they haven't seen us staring. I've never actually thought about how it must feel for the other person, to know that they are different and everywhere they go people are going to stare, point and even scream. So this book really made me open my eyes and see the issues that people with deformities face every single day. 
 This book does focus on a very difficult topic however I think it was handled brilliantly. The bullying wasn't covered up or made less obvious, it was shown exactly as it would be in real life. People are mean and this book shows us exactly how mean people can be and how difficult life is. 
 Although I didn't love this book I think it is definitely a book that everyone needs to read. If every single person in the world read this book think of how much better people with disfigurements would be treated. They would no longer be treated as freaks or outcasts, people would understand that it is ok to ask what happened to them as long as they do so in a kind way and not just scream out ""what the hell is wrong with your face!"" 
 I would definitely recommend this book to absolutely everyone, everyone needs to read it and understand the message that is being portrayed in this book. It is a fast read and is such an eye-opener. Go read it right now! 
 I would give this 5 stars but as I said it was just missing something for me, I don't exactly know what as it was fast and kept me gripped however I just don't think I would pick it up again and so for that reason I'm only giving it a 4 (sorry).

It's an amazing and emotional read that made me cry so much but that also inspired me to be a better person and a kinder person and to never forget that you shouldn't judge someone by their appearance alone. 
 This is the type of book that you'll be dying to press into someone elses hands to read as soon as you've finished it. Instead of tucking it onto your shelves, share it with everyone you know. It's incredible. When I reached the last page I had tears in my eyes but I was also smiling after joining Auggie on his wonderful journey to best friends and happiness. 
 There is a lot of buzz surrounding 'Wonder' but it's not until you actually read it yourself that you understand what it's all about. When I received this book I wasn't sure initially if it was going to be for me. It's certainly not the sort of book that I'd normally choose for myself. However, like the characters I learned not to be so hasty in my judgements as I soon became immersed in the story and rooting for the inspirational August - a little boy who has to endure so much but is still able to enjoy life and teach other people a thing or two about being a better person.

 This is one of those rare books that is secretly amazing but no one can tell you just how amazing you just have to read it for yourself. Although this book is for children or young adults it is really written for anyone over the age of ten. 
 Written from the view of children the writing presents a perfectly readable and honest view of middle school and high school issues from different sides. 
 This book made me laugh out loud, cry, sigh with peace, and smirk with secret knowledge. Any book that can do all that is a classic in my mind!

 Auggie is the most adorable teen year old ever. This story is about him and the people around him, his parents, his best friends, his sister, his classmates. It follows the life of August as he is transition into middle school after having been homeschooled all his life. 
 I was not immediately sucked into the story, it did take me four or five chapters to adjust but I'm really glad I didn't give up on it because the truth is, I needed something like this in my life. I needed a story about acceptance and kindness and this book delivered that completely. The story line was interesting and funny more lighthearted than intense and I loved that. 
 One of my favourite things about this book were all the different POVs. They were all interesting and insightful and I got to know better some of my favourite characters. You could feel the difference when it changed from on perspective to another, it was like their personality flowed to the writing. It was wonderful to read.

I bought this for my son because it was highly recommended, my son is in fifth grade like the protagonist, and he was in need of a book after finishing both the Percy Jackson and the Maze Runner series. However, this book is not a fantasy/adventure like he usually reads so he immediately dismissed it. Soon after, I spoke with a mother whose son is friends with a Downs child in our kindergarten. She mentioned her son is one of the few children who regularly plays with that child. Then I saw a post on Facebook from a parent with an Autistic child. The ""About Me,"" his child had filled out in school asked for the names of friends and the child had written, ""None."" I realized sometimes the problem is not that a child is mean, mine are not, but that kids aren't trained to recognize when someone is alone or being left out. I decided to read this book aloud to my kinder and second grader before at night. The book is about a boy with severe facial abnormalities who starts a regular school in fifth grade after being home schooled. It was so good even my fifth grader started coming in at night to hear the story. The would just complete their independent reading after I read some chapters to them (chapters are short.) I can not express enough how lovely this book was to read as a family. August, the main character, and his family, are so sweet. It is multiple POV so after one boy at school his mean to Auggie, the book switches to his perspective and my kids were given a chance to see why he was mean and how he felt afterward. It sparked so many conversations - not judging others based on appearances, how to stand up for others even when you're afraid, the importance of kindness. My kids laughed at me because there were so many nights when I would start tearing up. I had to teach them about how sometimes we cry not because we are sad, but because we are incredibly touched by something. This book was incredibly moving to me. My kids are ready to read the sequel, but I'm not sure I can do it.

 When I first heard about this book, I was wondering how the author was going to pull it off without making the story too ""After School Special."" She manages beautifully. 
 Told in multiple perspectives that bring a depth and authenticity to the work, it's still completely accessible and family-friendly, with no violence or vulgarity. If I were an elementary school teacher, I'd use this book in the classroom to discuss everything from feeling like an outcast to bullying. 
 It's not Augie's extreme facial deformity that kept him out of school. In his 10 years, he's had 24 reconstructive surgeries, and for the first time there's a long break from them, allowing him to attend a public school. He is small for his age as well and was not expected to live. 
 We start from Augie's POV as he's about to enter 5th grade. We then get pieces of the story told by his sister, two of his school friends (one who breaks his heart), his sister's boyfriend, and his sister's best friend. I love the chapters by Augie's sister Olivia (""Via"") because she had to understand at an early age, that Augie's needs come first. She says she's not being noble, but that once you've seen your baby brother with his jaw wired shut and IV tubes poking out all over his body, it seems kinda dumb to get upset about not getting that new toy. 
 As August is entering public school for the first time, Via is entering high school and dealing with her best friends' shunning. She has always been protective of August, but now she feels guilty because she doesn't want her new high school peers to know about him. She wants an independence separate from him and doesn't want to be known as ""the girl with the deformed brother."" 
 The premise is simple, and the characters drawn fairly complex for a middle grade novel. The bully and his mom may be a bit one-dimensional, but that's also because we never get their POV. As a class exercise, I think I'd have my students write a chapter based on the bully's POV. 
 This is such a feel-good story at the end that you'll be crying all over again, but it's not schlocky or too bubblegum. It's both heart-wrenching and heart-warming.","Mon Apr 30 23:30:40 -0700 2012","Sat Oct 06 09:39:44 -0700 2012","Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",1,0,"False"

 Wonder is one of those books that will stay with you forever. 
 I read Wonder in a span of 24 hours, a feat that doesn't usually happen and I became attached after reading the first couple of pages and this never happens either. That is how strongly this book has affected me. 
 I fear that this book review will not do Wonder justice. Wonder is something that needs to be read and felt and its hard to share these feelings with you in a coherent manner that feels sufficient. 
 Wonder follows the story of a 10 year old boy named Auggie (August) as he enrolls into school for the first time. Having being homeschooled prior to this, he's filled with worry about what will happen. Auggie is different and that leads to a yearlong run in with mean kids and unkind words. 
 Wonder is very character driven. The book is divided into different parts, each told from a different character's perspective. Although I expected more of Auggie's voice, I fell in love with the concept and seeing the same events through different eyes. It also allowed room for much character development. 
 Each character portrayed exceptional bravery and strength, that is beyond what you'd expect a 10 year old would face. Divorce issues, absent parents or being the sister of a boy with a birth defect. These characters were so compelling and grew into such wonderful caring children. 
 The story of Wonder goes beyond Auggie's struggle. It explores the topic of bullying, acceptance and kindness amongst others. It talks about important issues and doesn't shy away from reality (such as mean kids bullying the disabled etc) and it is done in such away that is thought provoking. 
 Wonder captured my heart from the start and it led to much needed self reflection of the way I treat people and how I present myself to others. To quote the book: ""sometimes you don't have to mean to hurt someone to hurt someone"".

 I wasn't sure if Wonder was going to be as good as I hoped...I felt it was either going to be too sad with lots of crying and heartbreak, or they would skirt around the problems and make it too funny. However R.J. Palacio got the perfect balance and also managed to write from the point of view of a young boy and make it believable. 
 The Characters were so real, each had their own personality, and own point of view on the events unfolding. Of course my favourite character has to be Auggie. He was such a brave kid and I was torn between giving him a massive hug and cheering him on as he was doing so brilliant by himself! R.J.Palacio has done a brilliant job of capturing the mindset of young children and how they react to difference, some embrace the difference and others do not. The part about Halloween was the biggest show of children and how they can actually be when adults are not around (tissue alert). 
 Even though I have just stated Auggie was my favourite, all the other characters come a close second! Via, his sister, is such a strong little girl it is amazing. So is Summer...I started laughing when Summer was telling her parents what to do and how to behave. However the characters are brilliant because the story switched points of view. I have to say the majority of the time, I love books that switch point-of-view...I am very much a person who likes to see the different interpretations and the different situations that lead someone to make those decisions, and Wonder did not fail. 
 I do think that if we had not seen the other points of view, it would not be the book I have fallen in love with. The characters grew so much in my mind when we saw them individually and in a sense go to see their side of the story. 
 Each character had their own personality that came through the writing and stood out from the others. Justin's story, after he met Auggie for the first time, was written in a different style and at first this confused me (I had been reading non-stop for an hour by this point...) but reflecting on it, the change really made his section as it felt more like the writings of a teenage boy. 
 Believe me when I say have a box of tissues on stand by...Every time Auggie cried, I cried...and this lead to one point where I didn't even realise I was crying until it was pointed out to me. This is mainly due to the constant use of first person narrative, another favourite of mine, which always makes everything feel more real and emotive. 
 Wonder is an amazing book, and I don't feel I can advise what age it should be for...possibly for 13 + but I don't feel like there is an age too old to read such an amazing book. Wonder is released next month, and I advise people to read this.","Tue Mar 13 06:44:48 -0700 2012","Thu May 31 08:18:41 -0700 2012","","",3,0,""

He's ten at the start of the book and about to start school for the first time, a tough enough challenge for any kid, never mind one who is used to people gasping in horror when they first catch a glimpse of him. I love how this book offered such a unique perspective and I thought it was a nice touch that it didn't solely focus on August's point of view but reserved chapters for the other characters as well. In order to understand the wider picture, it's important to acknowledge the perspectives of those around August, especially his family whose lives were also changed by August's deformity. 
 Whilst August struggles to fit in with his classmates, most of whom have an aversion to touching or being anywhere near him, he is quickly befriended by Summer and Jack who don't care about appearances or the 'cool' points they will lose for hanging out with August. It was a sweet story, but the realist in me couldn't help thinking that Palacio was giving ten year olds way too much credit. Unfortunately, there aren't many Jacks or Summers in the world, especially at the tender age of ten. Most ten years I knew rarely bothered to spare a thought for anyone else and just wanted to fit in with the cool crowd, myself included. If I hadn't explicitly been told otherwise, I would have assumed they were closer to 14 years old, but I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything else from a feel-good story aimed at a young audience. It could easily have been a lot darker had it been aimed at an older audience, but I suppose Palacio decided there was enough misery in the world as it is. 
 I think any reader ten and up would enjoy this, and perhaps benefit from getting inside the head of a person most people in reality would automatically recoil from. This book leaves you with a warm, mushy feeling and inspires you to be less like the Julians and more like the Summers of the world.","Fri Sep 22 13:18:23 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 28 09:58:56 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 22 13:18:47 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 -0700 2017",14,0,"False"

Too short, too tall, too fat, too thin, dumb blond, fiery tempered red head, bad hairstyle, poor skin - the list of things people criticise is endless! As much as we've all made snap judgements I'd also be willing to bet that we've all been on the receiving end to some degree or another too so really we should know what it feels like being judged for something you can't necessarily change about yourself. 
 Remember that pain of being teased for not quite fitting the ""norm""? Now imagine you're a 10 year old child, one who was born with severe facial disfigurements due to a genetic disorder, one who has suffered through the pain of multiple operations but still comes nowhere near close to looking like everyone else. Imagine that you've spent your entire life being stared at every time you step out of the house having people pointing at you, whispering about you, some even screaming in terror and running away from you. Now you have an idea about how Auggie has felt every single day of his life, not nice is it? How do you think that would shape you as a person? Would it leave you feeling bitter? How about depressed, miserable or insecure? I think I'd probably be all of those things but that is where Auggie is a much better person than I am! 
 Despite the problems he faces Auggie is one of the most positive characters you'll ever come across. He is absolutely beautiful in every way that is important and I dare you to read his story and not fall in love with him. Auggie has been lucky enough to grow up with a supportive and loving family and that shows in his bright and bubbly personality. He has always been home schooled but his parents think it is time he faced the world and learnt to deal with people's reactions to him. Watching Auggie bravely go to school and cope with the stares and taunts he receives is heartbreaking but seeing him slowly find a place and getting to know his classmates is beautiful. Inside he is a normal little boy who loves doing all the things other children his age do and as people get to know him they start to see beyond his looks to the person he is underneath. 
 Wonder is a stunning book and one that will stay with me for a long time. It is written mainly from Auggie's point of view but we also get to see things through the eyes of his sister and a couple of his classmates and discover first hand the effect Auggie has had on their lives. From the minute I picked up this book I didn't want to put it down. I was on a real roller coaster of emotions from sad to angry to proud and right through to happy. I adored Auggie, his family and his new found friends. I hated the students at school who teased him but I really loathed some of the adults for their attitude. It was easier to forgive a young child for a cruel remark made without malice than an adult who should know better. I was outraged on Auggie's behalf and wanted to climb into the book to protect him. 
 Anyone who has ever been bullied for any reason will automatically be able to relate to Auggie but what I think is even more important is that it will make people think about the way they act towards others. It will make you appreciate what you have and it will make you want to be a better person. If you're going to read one book this year make it Wonder, I promise you won't regret it. Whatever R.J. Palacio writes next will be going straight to the top of my wish list.","Sat Oct 29 09:35:31 -0700 2011","Fri Apr 13 12:25:56 -0700 2012","Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,2,"False"

To him it's just his face, but to everyone else it looks like he's terribly deformed. When Auggie turns 10, his parents decide it might be a good time to try to enroll him in school. He's dead-set against the idea, but after meeting some of his future classmates and visiting the private school he was accepted into, he thinks it might not be the worst thing ever. He knows kids can be cruel, and he's pragmatic about his future, but whether or not he'll be able to survive fifth grade remains to be seen. 
 I had known about this book for years before finally picking it up, and even then I returned it to library unread. But I decided it was finally time to read about August and his family, so I borrowed my sister's copy and actually read it pretty quickly. In some ways this book hit a little close to home, but in other ways it was so beyond my elementary school experience that I felt ridiculous even making the comparison (I don't know if it's worse to actually know why you're being teased, or to be teased for absolutely no reason at all). Either way, I think a lot of people can relate to Auggie, even if not for the same extreme reasons he has. I will say that in hindsight there's not a sweeping, dramatic story here, but the beauty of this book is how it tells a subtle story through big characters. The Pullmans are remarkable (but not inhuman), and the people surrounding their little solar system provide a lot of interest as they come and go, nearer to and farther from their sun. I felt like the writing was SO readable and authentic, especially as the narrating voice switched from time to time (which I didn't expect at all), and to see how people learned and changed. I think 10 years old is a hard age to write, and though August seemed a little too mature at times (though maybe he would be), it still seemed very genuine and he still generally sounded like a regular kid. Another thing that I really liked about him was that he wasn't overly unpleasant or snarky the entire time, which is quite refreshing for a book about this age group these days. The story is simple, but very effective and compelling. I didn't sob or get too emotional, but I felt kind of anxious the whole time, wondering what terrible thing might be about to happen -- most of the time it wasn't TOO terrible, which was always a relief, though there was definitely plenty of pretty terrible. Probably the most impressive thing about this book is that it was absolutely a message book, but it didn't feel preachy or condescending at ALL. Auggie was very pragmatic and understanding, all things considered, and while it might be a little overly sweet for some people, I think that's just exactly what it needed to be. I really liked how you gradually realized that, while the universe was not kind to August Pullman in some ways, it definitely made up for it in many others. 
 This was a pretty remarkable little book. It handled heavy issues without being preachy, it walked a fine line between miserable and delightful, and it made me examine some of my own feelings about appearances. I related to some of it a bit too much, but at the same time it was SO beyond my experience that all I could do was be grateful.","Tue Jun 11 10:39:14 -0700 2013","Tue Jun 16 14:13:11 -0700 2015","Mon Jan 26 00:00:00 -0800 2015","Tue Jan 20 00:00:00 -0800 2015",3,0,"False"

I've heard nothing but good things about it, but I'm not usually a huge fan of middle-grade stuff (tough, since 7th technically counts as one of those ""middle"" grades). However, out of curiousity, I cracked it open and started reading the first couple of chapters. I was hooked. I couldn't put it down, and (very carefully!) finished it within a couple of days. 
 Wonder is the story of August (Auggie) Pullman, who was born with a facial deformity that leaves him looking...more than a little different. As he says in the opening chapter ""I won't tell you what I look like. Whatever you're imagining, it's worse."" I kind of like that we don't get a description of his face right away -- in fact, I would have been fine with never getting a clear description of what exactly is ""wrong"" with Auggie. Since he's had numerous surgeries from the time he was born, Auggie has never attended real school. Yet at the start of his 5th grade year, his parents agree that he's ready. Auggie isn't so sure. 
 The novel takes place in Manhattan, and Auggie attends what is clearly an upscale prep school called Beecher Prep. This is totally the kind of school I would want to attend and teach at. Their 5th grade curriculum sounds more challenging than my own 7th grade teaching curriculum! Auggie has some fairly typical middle-school experiences -- he deals with bullies, he makes friends, he does awesome-sounding projects...he lives his life. Again, it would all be fairly normal-sounding if it weren't for the fact that Auggie is so different. All of his experiences are colored by his appearance. People are naturally predisposed not to give him a chance, simply because he looks ""weird,"" and this is definitely an age where fitting in is of the utmost importance. Thankfully, Auggie eventually finds some true friends -- Summer, who simply does not care what others think, and Jack, who does care, but learns an important lesson of his own through his friendship with Auggie. 
 Palacio employs multiple narrators here, although Auggie's perspective bookends the novel, and he gets the bulk of the narration duties. There are 6 narrators total, and although I'm not 100% convinced we needed to hear from Olivia's boyfriend and her former best friend (Miranda? Her name already escapes me!), I loved the distinction between each character's narrative voice. I've read several books with multiple narrators this year, and I think Will Grayson, Will Grayson was probably the most successful primarily because it was written by two authors (although their collaboration is pretty seamless). Crossed was unquestionably the least successful, since both narrators sounded exactly the same (Reached was a little better...at least Xander sounded distinct and Ky was unconscious for a good chunk of the story). All of these narrators had their own voices, and although I thought the 5th graders sometimes sounded a little more like 7th or 8th graders, I could easily tell the difference between all of them. I actually wish we could have heard more from Jack -- besides Auggie, his voice felt the most natural to me. And his storyline is very realistic -- he's reluctant to be singled out to help the ""weird new kid,"" but then he realizes that Auggie is actually kind of awesome. But he wants to be popular, and the popular kids definitely do not think Auggie is awesome. So for a while he gives in and acts like a jerk, which is completely believable. Kids can be a-holes. Most of them grow out of it, but almost every kid has gone through a time like this in their lives -- going along with the crowd even though they know they shouldn't. 
 I also really liked hearing from Auggie's sister Olivia. Her voice is the one that typically isn't heard in stories like this. We praise the kids like Auggie for their courage, and we praise the parents for their support (both totally justified!), but we rarely think about the effect all of this has on the siblings. Olivia has basically become self-sufficient, even though she's only 14, but she really does still need her parents and has to come to terms with the fact that she pretty much always has to come second to Auggie. Most of the time she's okay with that, but every now and then she's upset by how unfair it is -- because it's totally unfair. Olivia could totally turn into a sullen teenager or rebel to get attention, but she really just does her own thing. She has a couple of temper-tantrums, which again felt totally realistic to me. She's not a saint, she's a teenage girl, and sometimes teenage girls just want their parents' undivided attention. 
 Overall, I really adored this book. It did punch me in the heart a little -- I figured once they described the family dog as ""old"" that she wasn't going to make it to the end of the book. The scene was so well-written and heartbreaking (we see it from Auggie's perspective) that I had to have a good cry and hug my own puppy. The whole book felt very real -- maybe a teensy bit idealistic towards the end, when it's all a big love-fest and of course the bully just magically happens to be transferring to a new school. But who knows what will happen when they all show up for 6th grade. The kids actually sounded like kids (albeit, a little older than they were supposed to be), not like pretentious adults -- I'm looking at you, The Year of the Gadfly! At no point did I think Palacio was trying to ape John Green, as so many YA authors seem to be trying -- and failing -- to do. If anything, the overall voice reminded me a bit of Gary Schmidt's The Wednesday Wars, another book that does a great job with a young narrative voice that doesn't sound overly mature or pandering.

He has had so many surgeries that he was home-schooled until fifth grade when his parents decided it was the right time to start school. Auggie attends a private school in New York City where he is met daily with fearful glances. The teachers and some of the kids have learned to accept his differences. However, kids and even parents of the other students can be cruel. Auggie handles these challenges with courage. Middle school isn't easy for most but Auggie takes each day one step at a time. He has a small group of 
 friends but it isn't until he attends a school overnight camping trip with his classmates that he realizes friends and supporters may come from the least likely classmates. 
 Wonder is an absolutely fabulous book. Not only does the author present Auggie's perspective but she shows us the views of his sister, her boyfriend and Auggie's classmates. These perspectives show us how everyone has to deal with Auggie's needs. We all need to be a little more accepting. A little nicer. A little more caring. This world and especially our schools would be a better place. Although this book is geared towards tweens (grades 3-8), I would recommend everyone read it. Even adults. It might teach you a lesson that you hadn't thought about since grade school days.","Tue Aug 05 12:56:33 -0700 2014","Wed Aug 06 07:43:58 -0700 2014","","",0,0,""

I generally find children of all ages annoying, so powering through this book, which is told from multiple child perspectives, was quite an effort. That information is quite relevant to this review since people who aren't as averse to those creatures will probably enjoy it more since the story is somewhat geared towards pulling on your heartstrings and telling the story of a kid with a facial deformity going to school for the first time. 
 Even though it annoyed me, the fact that each perspective uses language that is consistent with the child doing the narrating was a nice touch and went a long way to making the whole story more believable. One issue with the audiobook version was that the narrator who did the protagonist's voice went all out in trying to replicate the gravelly voice the character had, which was especially painful to listen to. Regarding the multiple perspectives, I thought that while it was somewhat interesting to hear the thoughts of some of the fringe characters, those could easily have been left out since they didn't actually add anything to the story. 
 Now onto the main problem I had with this book. This is obviously aimed at children, so it tries very hard to get some moral lessons across, the main one of which is about being kind, especially to people less fortunate than you since they also have feelings. That's all well and good, but there were some other inadvertent lessons as well which were more disturbing. Firstly there was the case of the parents neglecting their other child because all their attention was spent on the one with all the issues. That can be somewhat forgiven, but not when the neglected child says she's ok with it (which I highly doubt any real child would be) and the parents keep ignoring her anyway when she needs someone to talk to. Then there's the issue of the parents being overprotective and not preparing their kid for the real world. What kind of parent doesn't talk to their child about the hardships they're likely to face due to the child's condition and give him some advice on how to deal with it? I could go on and on about all the dodgy lessons kids would pick up from this book, but I'll just mention one more that got on my nerves: happy endings. It's a bit of a weird one since this kind of book is guaranteed a happy ending, but it's very forced and unrealistic. The issue I have with it is that this could give hope to someone with similar issues that everyone will like them regardless of their deformity if they just keep being kind themselves. This is so implausible it's actually sad. 
 I suspect most children are probably too stupid to pick up on those inadvertent lessons and will hopefully ignore the ones they can tell are there to make the story have some drama. I honestly can't recommend this to anyone over ten and even then I'd feel the need to explain to them what the phrase ""with a pinch of salt"" means.","Tue Oct 18 20:37:13 -0700 2016","Thu Oct 20 21:48:15 -0700 2016","Fri Oct 21 02:50:50 -0700 2016","Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 -0700 2016",1,0,"False"

The main character, August, has a couple of severe genetic defects which have resulted in him being home-schooled due to surgeries and such. Finally, at the start of fifth grade, he enters school. It is a learning experience for everyone. Auggie is forced to face the cruelty of kids, and the kids get their first experience with someone who looks truly 'different'. It's a tumultuous experience to say the least. 
 What I liked most was the fact that the main point behind the book was that Auggie was normal, even if it he didn't look it. He's very matter of fact about the way he looks, and the way people tend to react to them. Even remarking at one point on how people don't think they see him staring, but he does, and that he's mostly okay with it. He understands why they do it. 
 ""Hey, the truth is, if a Wookiee started going to the school all of a sudden, I'd be curious, I'd probably stare a bit! And if I was walking with Jack or Summer, I'd probably whisper to them: Hey, there's the Wookiee. And if the Wookiee caught me saying that, he'd know I wasn't trying to be mean. I was just pointing out the fact that he's a Wookiee."" 
 -- R.J. Palacio, Wonder 
 and he's definitely up for poking fun at himself. 
 ""I think we're too young to be dating. I mean I don't see what the rush is."" Summer says. 
 ""Yeah, I agree,"" said August. ""Which is kind of a shame, you know what with all those babes who keep throwing themselves at me and stuff?"" 
 -- R.J. Palacio, Wonder 
 The quote that meant the most to me though was: 
 ""the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way."" 
 -- R.J. Palacio, Wonder 
 The mini-reviewer and I spent a few moments discussing that one. How Auggie looks different, but it's only a physical presentation. How he's just another kid on the inside. It lead to deeper discussions later on, too. Like how Auggie didn't look nice at all, but was a nice person inside, whereas the one who was nice looking on the outside was ugly on the inside. 
 R.J. Palacio's book doesn't just give us the typical 'be nice to everyone' or 'people are all different' though. She also avoids the whole thing in literature where a character who is different serves as the springboard for some epic gooodness/understanding for the protagonist. August is the center point of this book. His journey isn't some Disney-washed version of a Grimm's tale. He can't just have more surgeries or get a magic cure to make him fit in with those around them. He has to make it on personality and persistence alone. That's not to say this isn't a happily-ever-after book, because in some ways, it is. But it's a kids book. Let them have their happy ever afters. They need it. 
 I dreaded reading this book all the way through, early on, with the kiddo. It gave us some serious discussion time. It was an emotional sap for me at points. I hated Wonder opening her eyes to the fact that people could be toe-rags. (There's a conversation Auggie and his mom have that made her so disappointed when she understood what they were talking about.) But in the end? It was a nice overall experience for us. I never had to prod her to read this book. She was always willing and eager to read at least a few pages. That says something. 
 Wonder is an extremely character-driven book. Apart from August, it's told from a few different character's perspectives. You only see the viewpoints of those who are affected/changed in some way by what they experience with or around August. Minor characters stay minor. It's also got a very nice, and strong, anti-bullying message to it. 
 Wonder is one of those books that will definitely affect parents more than it affects kids. However, it's definitely a book that both kids and adults can enjoy. 
 Mini-Reviewer's Thoughts: 
 Wonder is a really good book. I liked Auggie because he was really cool even though he had stuff wrong with his face like cleft palate. Even though he looked different, he still looked great. He was a good kid and he had a good attitude. I liked that he liked Star Wars, and I think he probably looked cool in his astronaut helmet. He wore it because he didn't want people seeing his face. Summer was a good kid throughout the book. She was nice just because. I was happy that the other kids finally learned they couldn't get Auggie's broken pieces, because its not a virus or something. You can't catch broken lungs or something. You are born with them like I was.

 Going into fifth grade is a hard transition for any child, but for August (Auggie) Pullman, it is particularly difficult. Not only is it his first time in a traditional school, but Auggie has lived his entire life with severe facial deformities, and he knows firsthand how hurtful an offhanded look or comment can be, even when it's not meant to be cruel. So, Auggie understands that that middle school is going to be rough... ""like sending a lamb to slaughter"" as described by his father. 
 It's hard to imagine just how challenging such an experience could be, which is why this particular novel is so impressive. Palacio's biggest accomplishment with this story is bringing to light how Auggie's life affected and changed the lives of those around him. August is our first narrator, and through him we are able to get a firsthand glimpse at his struggles, thoughts, and experiences. But by offering multiple points of view, ranging from his friends to family, we are able to get outside of his head and understand how his life challenged those who loved him. Wonder is the story about a regular who kid who overcomes extraordinary challenges and changes lives in the process. He does all of this with integrity, courage, and compassion, leaving you feel empowered to change your own.","Thu Apr 12 07:16:08 -0700 2012","Mon Jul 09 12:52:30 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

I don't normally read middle grade fiction, even as I begin the process of co-writing a middle grades book with a darling friend of mine (and another book blogger). Maybe it was her insistence that MG had stuff to discover that drew me to try a MG book, or the suggestion of this book from a friend on a website I commonly visit. All I knew going into this was that it made some people cry and that it was about a little boy with a facial deformity. Not my usual reading fare at all, but this book really surprised me. 
 WONDER is about August Pullman, a boy beginning fifth grade and school for the first time. The reason? He was born with a genetic defect that left his face rather unsightly (according to most of the people he has encountered in his life). I did some research and, while never explicitly mentioned, I wonder if he has Treacher-Collins Syndrome or something similar. Google it if you're curious! Anyway, August is starting his first year of school at Beecher Academy, where the kids have never been exposed to someone like him. The story is about his trials and tribulations, along with the experiences of the young people around him, as he makes his way through this brave new world and the life that awaits him. 
 Auggie has never known any different than what he is. He was born with a strange face and grew up with it. People have always treated him like he was a monster, from little children to adults. But he is a strong character, powerful in mind and conviction. Being sent to school is something he is hesitant about, especially for the first few months, but he grows and changes - just as the people around him grow and change. 
 The story is told in a number of points of view - August, his sister Via, schoolmates Jack and Summer, Via's boyfriend Justin, and Miranda, Via's old best friend. From these people, the story of August is painted, from the friendships he has to the experiences of what it takes to know and love him. As the reader, we're exposed to every angle of the story, even though at least one POV wasn't really necessary (Justin). The differentiation between narration also ignored me. All six sounded very similar in tone, although Justin's POV was...weird. 
 What I had a problem with in this story was the fact that the story was neatly tied up in a perfect bow. I won't give things away, but the story became predictable in its message from page one. It's a MG book and of course MG isn't going to go down the dark road taken by adult stories. Oh, wait, does this spoil the story? Well, let me just say it's predictable. End of story. 
 This story did not shy away from the hard-hitting topics otherwise. Readers play witness to bullying, intimidation, fear, childhood drama, and medical conditions that drag the reader into the hard life our protagonist and his family has had. This story is touching, heartbreaking, and uplifting all in one. 
 Oh, and I should mention that I actually cried. But it wasn't because of Auggie himself. I won't spoil the story, but it really struck a chord with me (the event) because the exact same thing happened to me. 
 Even if you are not a fan of middle grade fiction, WONDER is worth a look. I believe most readers will enjoy this story through and through - the characters, the plot, the setting of a fifth grade full of turmoil. This was a great introduction for me into the world of MG fiction, and although I don't think I will become a HUGE reader in the field, I do plan on trying to read more into the lives of tweens entering the world of middle school, which I admit, I personally enjoyed a lot more than high school. 
 VERDICT: Touching and warming, WONDER is a unique take on something many fear to tread on. A must read for newcomers to today's middle grade fiction.","Wed Feb 22 22:47:23 -0800 2012","Thu Apr 26 23:56:40 -0700 2012","Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,0,"False"

 I love that the story of August's first year of school is told from so many characters' point-of-view.

 This is a lovely read, Auggie himself is endearing, funny, believable, and most importantly he is deeply loved, supported and accepted by his parents and his sister. It could be said this novel is an illustration of the maxim that it is ultimately 'what is on the inside that counts', writ large. But maybe Auggie wouldn't be who he is without being as he is. He has had to learn to deal with peoples' reactions to him, on seeing his face, from shock or fear, to acceptance and friendship from some, or unkindness and taunting from others. He is a kind-hearted boy, who is so happy seeing those he loves enjoy success. On seeing his sister Via receive applause he decides; 'I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives. 
 The novel offers, through Auggie, a real insight into how it must feel to be considered 'different', and how a child might deal with this. At first when the narrator was no longer Auggie I wondered how well it would work, having gotten used to seeing things from his perspective and enjoying this, but I needn't have worried, as the other characters' sections all add to Auggie's story rather than detract from it. The story isn't just about how Auggie is different though, it's about all the things he experiences that are the same as anyone else of his age, such as not being sure he wants his mum to kiss him in front of everyone anymore, making new friends, getting used to middle school, and so on. 
 This novel is aimed at a children's and young adult audience but it wouldn't harm anyone of any age to read it and be reminded not to judge by appearances and to be a little kinder to others, and it will reward those who do read it with a moving, at times dark, but also uplifting read.","Sun Jan 05 11:14:46 -0800 2014","Fri Jan 31 06:57:30 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 19 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 05 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0,""

 *ahem* 
 Ten-year-old August Pullman has been homeschooled since he was real little, but he has not been isolated. Besides his mom and dad, his grandparents and his big sister Via and his dog Daisy have been loving and kind to him. The small neighborhood children play with him without a second thought. He has lived as a normal kid in every way - video games, playground fun, ice cream. He adores all of the Star Wars movies! 
 But he also has survived twenty-seven painful surgeries on his face. He can finally eat normally and he has learned to keep his tongue inside his mouth. Still, he hides his face either by wearing a baseball helmet or by brushing his long hair forward. He is sort of used to the stares, the gasps of horror, and then the struggle of people to behave as if nothing is wrong. He IS normal except for his face. He was born with a couple of gene mutations, resulting in ""mandibulofacial dysostosis... complicated by a hemifacial microsomia characteristic of OAV spectrum."" ""... multifactorial inheritance."" 
 However, his parents feel it is time he attend a middle school. He has been placed into the fifth grade after taking a test. August is more than nervous about this. It isn't only that he might be academically challenged. He knows the kids won't want anything to do with him. There might be teasing, even bullying. Those bad things HAVE happened now and then. Will anyone be his friend? 
 August cries the night before his first tour of the school. During the tour with his parents the next day everyone does double-takes, and he meets three kids who were asked to show him around. Only one of them is not nice to him, but it is ok. 
 Finally, it is the first day of school. What is going to happen? What would his favorite Star Wars character, Boba Fett, do? After all, people always act the same. It couldn't be worse than what stuff has already happened, especially the surgeries he has had and the surgeries he knows are scheduled in the future. He is ten - he isn't really little anymore! Besides, he really would like a friend.... 
 August undergoes trials and triumphs, reader. 
 In the real world, middle-school kids can be surprisingly cruel and astonishingly kind - and they often do not seem to have any reason for their choice of behavior at all, much less choices made from that of seeing a really different-looking kid for the first time. Of course, kids this age have other dramas at home going on which affect what they do, too. Parental guidance is hugely important. I think the book quietly and intelligently handles all of these issues and more. However, the ending goes a little off the rails because the last third of the novel builds up to an over-the-top tearjerker finish, and the pacing was noticeably wrong as well , but by the time I got to the last chapter, it ultimately made emotional sense. There are multiple points of view included in alternating chapters from August's sister and others smoothly worked into the action which add depth, too. 
 Anyway, 'Wonder' wasn't written for cynical adults like me. Young middle-school kids are the intended audience, and for most it will be a read that induces thought and empathy. But parents should maybe read along, or a teacher. I suspect some boys will feel it is too preachy or girly, so, probably a little adult encouragement might help. (Emotional IQ is complicated by immaturity and dogpack instincts for some boys at this age, sorry to mention.)","Wed May 31 19:05:24 -0700 2017","Sat Jul 01 14:35:44 -0700 2017","Sat Jun 03 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Wed May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2017",17,3,"True"

Although the book is about a fifth grade boy, the book is a commentary on human nature and how we treat those who are different. 
 The main character, Auggie, is very different. Born with severe facial deformities, he has been home schooled by his mother. Fifth grade is the beginning of middle school, and it's time for Auggie to try to make friends and venture out into the real world. 
 Just one of the many things that the author gets right is the fact that often, parents end up on different sides of an issue. And in 'Wonder,' no sooner does one parent change sides than the other parent does also. Frustrating, but very true-to-life. 
 The characters in 'Wonder' are also very true-to-life: the school suck-up who makes all the teachers and administrators think he (or she) is wonderfully kind and generous, but who really is a miserable excuse for a human being -- enjoying the misery of others.

 Wonder is the story of the first year of August Pullman in real school, fifth grade, with other students in a not-inclusive prep school. August's face is severely deformed, though he is not special needs: he can perform physically and mentally within the range of his age group (probably towards the lower end on the physical scale because he is little and not very athletic and towards the higher end in academics, since he is very smart and home schooled well by his mother previously.) He has a loving family, complete with a caring, protective (and beautiful) older sister and a great dog. He also is upper middle class, judging from him having a whole room to himself and an XBox and an iMac computer (the income difference is highlighted in a scene with his best bud, who complains he does not even has his own room, let alone a computer). 
 August hates his face. Understandable. August has a difficult start to the year, though from the very beginning there are people who treat him nice. He is, in return, a generally nice kid. His nemesis is the school popular (rich) kid, Julian, who thinks (like everyone else) that August is a freak and goes out of his way to make him unwelcome. Despite all of this and several set backs, August manages to develop friendships, overcome difficulties, and have a generally good year in fifth grade. All in all, it is a heartwarming story. 
 I am not sure, though, what the main point is, or that it is one that I agree with. Basically, August gets an award in the end for being courageous (or kind, but literal words of Mr. Tushman are more about courage, not being kind). As August himself says, he is basically given an award for having a deformed (or differently formed) face. I was thinking he would get an academic award, because he was one of the top students. That would have been great. And if anyone deserved an award for being courageous and kind and all those things the principal listed, it would have to be August's best friend, Jack Will, who had to overcome his own prejudices, his fear of the popular kids and his desire to be a part of the popular crowd, then had to stand up and defend August against seventh graders. 
 The message, to be kind, better yet, to be kinder than necessary, is a good one, I agree. But I am not sure if August is very kind himself. For example, when Julian asks August why his face is deformed, which I believe is the kind of question that should be encouraged and not considered rude (as August has the right always to tell him to fuck off or answer in any way he wants), August immediately has an internal rant about Julian. The other kids are embarrassed that Julian asked this question, whereas they are all thinking the same thing and later, they all call August freak behind his back. In the same scene, the first thing August says to anyone is to correct Julian's mistake in pronouncing a word in front of all the other kids. August appears, to me, as unkind and vengeful, not kind and understanding. August is understandably mean to Julian, no doubt about that. But he never really shows any indication (at any point) of being exceptionally kind to others. He has problems that preoccupy him and he is usually only concerned about himself (there are a few exceptions, like when he does not want to leave Jack Will behind when Jack is defending him against the seventh graders). He is so concerned with his own problems (again, understandable) that he does not even realize their dog is very sick and dying. 
 Perhaps the most problematic character in the book is Julian's mom. Her emotional reaction to August is probably not extreme, but her lack of tact and disregard of what is politically correct is unrealistic. No posh, rich American woman would be so tactless in expressing her discrimination of a small, deformed kid. It just does not make sense. Having been around posh, rich kids who have posh, rich parents, one thing I know is that they all know what is politically correct and try hard not to appear discriminating on the surface, if not genuinely non-discriminating. Why wouldn't they? They know the rules of the game and they play it to their advantage. Perhaps we're supposed to believe that her behavior is realistic, because parents will go to the extreme for their kids, but even then, a family that can easily send their child to some other expensive school would not bother with such petty business. 
 The choices of points of view were also a bit odd. August, his sister, and Jack are obvious choices and they make sense. Sister's boyfriend makes a lot less sense, also considering he is not destined to be a long-term character in their lives (unless sister is going to grow old with the first ever boy she dated). Sister's best friend, who consider's August family, is an OK choice, but still a bit off the mark. There are other, better choices, like Julian, a teacher or Mr. Tushman, one of the boys who changes sides and helps Jack and August against the seventh graders, even the dying dog! Perhaps the choices are related to the continuation of the story and will make more sense then?

Palacio has written a superb novel for children (and adults) teaching us all how fragile life can be and how important it is to learn to love and be kind to everyone. This story is told from the perspective of several young fifth grade children and a couple of older students. The adult teachers interact, but minimally. We see the growth of Auggie and his friends over the length of a school year. Even though Auggie knows school will be difficult because of his facial abnormalities, he loves school and perseveres with the teasing, cliques, and bullying.

 August Pullman is ten year old and likes the same things every other ten year old boy likes; Star Wars, his X-box, ice-cream and his dog. On the inside, Auggie feels like an ordinary boy too, on the outside though, he anything but ordinary. August was born with an extreme facial abnormality and even though he has had numerous operations to ""normalise"" his features, he still looks anything but ordinary. 
 For the first ten years his parents have kept him at home. Initially because of all the operations and other health related issues, but also to protect him from a world that can't deal with his features. Now that he is ten though his parents decide that it is time for him to start going to school and to enter the world where he will have to deal with how others see him for the rest of his life. 
 August doesn't look forward to going to school. He is well aware of how people react to him and fears the worst. Soon, it seems that all his fears are confirmed. All most all the other kids ignore him, treating him as if he has some deadly contagious disease. Although there is one girl, Summer, who, from the very first day, accepts him just as he is, Auggie's time in school is lonely and painful, especially when Jack, who Auggie thought was his friend, appears to betray him. 
 Have Auggie's parents made a horrible mistake in sending him to school or will he manage to convince the others that he really is just like everybody else? 
 I'm not entirely sure what to say about this book, or even how to grade it. On the one hand it is a beautiful and well written story about overcoming differences and discrimination. The story deals with prejudice and bullying, tries to show the reader that a person is more than what you see on the outside and that it is important not to judge a person by their appearance. 
 And, I think the book almost succeeds in that. 
 My problem is that the very important message in this book is lost a bit as a result of the too good to be true, Walt Disney like fairy-tale ending. While I love a happy ending as much as the next person I think the anti-bullying and trust your inner strength message would have come across more clearly if the book had ended on a positive but not magically so note. 
 As much as I would like the world and the people in it to be and react as described in this book, I'm only too aware that just isn't the case. And that makes me wonder. This book will be read by kids who face their own struggles against prejudice and people who can't look beyond the obvious. Is it fair to parade a magical but ultimately unrealistic happy ending in front of those real kids facing problems in the real world? 
 Read this book as the wonderful fairy-tale it is and my grade would be a 5. Because I feel this book could, and maybe should, have been more I've settled on a grade 4.

So glad I got back to it. Although it gets a bit preachy at times, and I was hit over the head by some of the themes, it's a lovely story. 
 10-year-old August Pullman, born with a craniofacial abnormality (his face is ""deformed""), has been homeschooled by his mother, but his parents have decided that he should go to school for the first time as a fifth grader. It doesn't take much to imagine how hard this must be for everyone involved; fifth grade is hard enough for anyone to get through (as one character says late in the novel), but ""the universe was not kind to August Pullman"", and his first year of real school is rough. Luckily, he is smart and wry and very aware of how he appears to others, so it's easy to come to love him as much as his family does (at first) and his new friends do (later, after a lot of bumps along the way). 
 The novel is painful and poignant and funny and (mostly) realistic, and touches on lots of good YA themes. The writing is clear and uncomplicated, and does a great job just staying out of the way. I can't help but wonder how long it'll take for this to be made into a movie; it has just the right pacing, plot, and story tidiness that could become a good one.

 It's a feel-good story, tears and smiles and all that. A good book to read to a child. A sweet story to help us believe in the good in people. This would be an amazing choice for a kid's book club. 
 I think I'm too cynical for this, though. The lost star is because there weren't any hold-outs who refused to be swayed by the speech at the end combined with August's humor and charm and courage. And we all know, there would have been some, and August could have recognized that and been okay.

It felt like a very ""natural"" read, if that makes any sense - the story flowed very well and I got caught up in the story and just wanted to continue reading. Not because I was dying to find out what happened next, like in some super action packed fantasy novel, but just because reading this book was a very pleasant and natural experience. 
 Basically, Wonder is about a boy named August who is born with a number of unfortunate illnesses that end up in a very rare combination which leaves him with a pretty severe facial deformity. He's gone his whole life dealing with this and putting up with people's reactions in his own way, but at the start of this novel his parents have decided to try and have him attend school for the 5th grade, instead of being homeschooled like he previously was. And not surprisingly, going to middle school for the first time looking like Auggie has a big set of challenges. 
 August himself is an endearing character. He has his moments of ""woe is me,"" but he's also funny and sarcastic. And he's not afraid to be himself, which is awesome. Not just in terms of owning his appearance, but in some of his opinions that his classmates might not always share, like the fact that he's not ready to even think about dating yet. He love Star Wars and while he tones down things like having a Star Wars backpack so he doesn't get known for just being a Star Wars freak, he acknowledges that he will always love it. He felt like a very real person. The other characters are well thought out too, especially his sister Via, who I would have loved to see even more of. 
 Despite his challenges, the book still has a really positive tone overall. It emphasizes the theme of kindness, with the message at the end to ""be kinder than necessary."" I think this is a simple but great lesson, especially to emphasize to middle school students. 
 In some ways, the positivity does venture on unbelievable at times - because August gets a happy ending where everyone in the school loves him (except for the one main bully, who luckily is transferring schools next year!). Even the kids that bullied him and made fun of him behind his back all love him. I dunno, in some ways it seems really far fetched and it would have felt more realistic if he had his close group of friends that he developed and the teachers that appreciated him, and maybe the rest of the school was indifferent to him rather than all trying to be his buddy. But on the other hand, this is a book, not real life. And books don't always have to reflect reality. Especially if we want kids this age to learn kindness, we should at least make it possible for them to envision what the world could be, even if it isn't always that way. 
 The only thing I had a major problem with was the fact that the story shifted point of view 6 times. We hear from August, Via, Via's boyfriend Justin, her friend Miranda, and August's friends Summer and Jack. All the shifting seemed a little unnecessary and I'm not sure why it was done, other than an ""easy way out"" to describe how a character was feeling about something. I think the book could have just alternated between August and Via's point of views and that would have been fine. 
 Overall I really enjoyed this one. I had super high expectations going in because everyone at the library raves about this book and we have like a million copies of it. I was thankful for the more positive spin on things and the fact that this wasn't just another big tear jerker of a story of a kid with problems. It had a little of everything - sadness, but happiness, and parts that made you laugh too. Highly recommended to everyone.","Sat Jan 25 20:22:27 -0800 2014","Tue May 19 07:38:05 -0700 2015","Mon May 18 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Tue May 12 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0,"True"

Some even say that it will be on a lot of awards lists, and lo and behold, it's starting to look that way. Your heart just leaks love for Auggie. He was born with a deformity and you know his life isn't peaches and ice cream. It's easy to cheer him on as he braves school for the first time as a 5th grader. Predictably, Auggie meets some not so nice kids and while you want to wring their necks for the things they say, you hope that there will be some sort of learning experience in all this. Luckily, not all of Auggie's new classmates are meanies. There are a few bright gems and the whole time I was thinking that I hope to gosh that my kids would like them. They didn't fall in line with the others when they would pretend Auggie had ""the plague."" It was sad to read when the kids were mean to Auggie, but when the parents jumped on board...I was livid! I think it's important for kids to know that grown ups make mistakes too, but some of those scenes filled with hate were difficult to read. 
 I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of perspectives in this story. I thought it would be about Auggie and Auggie alone. We get to peek inside the mind of Auggie's adoring sister, Auggie's friends from school and in the end we hear from 6 voices. Pretty daring for a middle grade novel! Personally, I enjoyed this aspect of the story. I did not care for Auggie's voice read by Diana Steele. It was a voice that just grated on my nerves and was painful. Diana read for other characters and I really enjoyed those a lot. There was just something about that 10-year old voice that I couldn't get past. I choose to read the book version for Auggie's parts. 
 That aside, this book is so full of heart! With the multiple points of view, I can see this being a great read-aloud for classrooms. This book should start conversations with young readers. What would you do if you were in Auggie's shoes? How can you make a difference in someone's life? Auggie's story can provide so many teachable moments for kids about empathy and friendship.

 So so so good! Everyone needs this in their lives. It's just so beautiful and it makes you kinda second guess everything around you. The characters were adorable (I especially liked the characters Justin, August and Jack). AND FOR A MIDDLE GRADE BOOK, WOW!!! 
 Only thing is that the characters Summer and Charlotte didn't stick well with me, and I didn't appeal to the chapter that Summer had to herself. 
 I did like Via Justin and Miranda though, they were just as good as Jack Will Summer and Auggie. 
 And the bullying was done so right (I feel just awful for saying that but it's how it is) especially the end part where Eddie attacks August and Amos and Henry, etc save him and Jack Will

 Great, now that's out of the way, I might as well get on with my review. 
 In Wonder, we follow the times and troubles of 10-year-old August Pullman as he begins his very first year of school. Due to the many surgeries he had to undergo because of the rare syndrome deforming his face, he has been homeschooled by his mother ever since he was a kid. Now his parents want him to go to school, in order to receive a proper education, but August definitely isn't happy about this. He is in fact very well aware of how people see him and has no envy whatsoever to become the school's laughingstock. But then, a meeting with the principal, and the right few words manage ti convince him. Needless to say, this isn't going to be easy. At all. 
 Now, what I loved about this book was that it was very simply written. And by that I don't mean it didn't have depth or it used too simple grammar: I mean it was written without complicated metaphors or absurd syntactic stucture, which I ally, really appreciated. Many books I've read lately have forced me to go back and reread whole paragraphs, because I couldn't understand their meaning, but not Wonder. R.J. Palacio writes clearly, simply, and with an awful amount of sincerity - especially when it comes to describing August's feelings and impressions. 
 I also really liked the fact that the book was split into different POVs, because that way I managed not only to see the world through August's eyes, but through the eyes of all those who are close to him, as well: his sister, who has been trying to protect him from harm ever since he was a baby, but suddenly wants to have a life of her own, and hates herself for being so ""selfish""; his friend Jack, who gives up popularity and severs a lot of friendships just to help him out; Summer, a really pretty girl who ends up becoming August's best friend; and even Julian, the bully who will do all that's in his power to make August's life miserable. 
 It was especially nice, seeing how all these different puzzle pieces, coming from different minds, could fit together to form one extremely moving, incredibly deep big picture. I enjoyed seeing the characters grow and deal with their problems and smile through their tears. I loved its unwavering sincerity, even in front if things that people too often prefer to hide.","Sat Sep 27 07:15:02 -0700 2014","Wed Apr 08 12:09:59 -0700 2015","Tue Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sat Sep 13 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 Actual Rating : 4.5 Stars 
 Wonder is about a ten year old August Pullman (Auggie) , a little boy born with a severe facial deformity . He was home_schooled because of his health and several surgeries . until now , he's to start 5th grade , a new school , an ordinary kid with an unusual face . 
 we read from several POVs including his Family and Friends, all these people who are sharing the journey with Auggie . Its a beautiful story full of compassion and its so well worth the time it takes to read it. 
 The tribulation little Auggie is being through at such a young age and his positive attitude and shiny personality in response is impressing . one would really feel for Auggie, 
 a ten years old boy ,through all that, is expected to be whiny ( no judgement , human can turn whiny when its too hard to withstand ) , gloomy , insecure and to push people away from him , but surprisingly , Auggie , the little dude , is such a fine character , too funny , too light-hearted. 
 He repeated through out the book that he's okay with people staring , he would think "" I understand , I would be staring if it was me "" , to describe the whole experience of it as if a barely noticed drizzle ""I'm used to that by now. I don't let it bother me. It's like when you go outside and it's drizzling a little. You don't put on boots for a drizzle. You don't even open your umbrella. You walk through it and barely notice your hair getting wet."" , a ten years old boy thinking this way is too enthralling , you can't but adore him with all of the bit of a heart you have , smart and funny and brave and understanding as he is . 
 And I really like that as The book starts with august's POV he wont be mentioning a frank description of his face when you're in his head. He simply mentions ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" but then when we got to Via's section she lays Auggie's looks on the line. Its makes all characters POVs too real , we can notice how different things seem in people's minds . 
 The whole story in fact felt real . The way Via felt shadowed by her brother and wanting to keep him a secret in her high school life , yet the way she loves him so much . Other things like jack explaining himself to Julian though he didn't really mean it , the way people are not totally good or bad , What I want to say is that it felt real because they all made mistakes but by the end it came to light that what one sticks to is what defines them , all of this has painted the book with a realistic light , except for the end , which is the sole reason its 4.5 stars instead of solid 5 , it was a bit too bright , though i have to admit that inspite of the logic suggesting this , it still made me all teary while reading it , it was emotionally absorbing . 
 Wonder is a beautifully written story , it is designed to be read by younger readers so yes it isn't as rich as it could have been otherwise. but its a positive point because it also means that children would have no problem reading it , children books to be served in a simple way is most definitely not a blemish in their structure . 
 This is a story to teach you about the good that humanity is capable of, the falseness of first impressions , the courage of some people and the way one little boy could win the hearts of so many . 
 'Greatness,' wrote Beecher, 'lies not in being strong, but in the right using of strength. . . . He is the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.

I liked that the narrator changed and you got to see a number of different sides of what was going on. Sometimes this was the same scene from different view points, but sometimes it was person A narrating the winter and person B narrating the spring. 
 I liked that August, our hero, does not describe himself. You have to wait until the sister gets to tell her side to find out about what is wrong with him. 
 I like that, while things are not easy for August, they are not unrealistically hard either. Mostly, he deals with being a social pariah and struggling to find his place in middle school. Yes, there are some bullies and meaner than usual pranks, but no, his every day is not a living nightmare of harassment. 
 It's possible that the end was a little too unrealistically happy, but if I wanted realism, I'd spend time listening to my twins fighting instead of reading fun books like this one. 
 (Listened to the audio version about six months after I read it. Still love this book. They have different narrators for the different sections (which I like). Augie's voice is a little scratchy, but he also describes his voice that way in the book, so it makes sense.)","Thu Feb 16 09:44:04 -0800 2012","Thu Aug 23 11:13:53 -0700 2012","","",1,0,""

 Wonder is a YA book about a young boy, Auggie Pullman, entering a public school 5th grade class after being home schooled his whole life due to a facial deformity. He's suffered through numerous operations and while he can function (eat, speak, hear), his appearance turns heads. Palacio makes the right choice by not describing Auggie's face and letting the reader imagine what he must look like. Right out of the gate you know there's bound to be tears with a premise like that. 
 In fact, I thought it would be a lot more difficult to read about Auggie's struggles but he is never put in a challenging situation without friends or support for very long. With Auggie going into 5th grade the writing is geared towards a younger audience than I think I usually read in the YA genre. The characters and situations were much more black and white - the good people were SO good and the bad people were SO bad. In reality, most people are going to be a very muddled mix of generous, accepting, selfish and insensitive. The character of Auggie's sister comes the closest to a real person, struggling to always put Auggie first and be proud of him in front of new middle school friends. 
 This is probably the right level of conflict and the right stakes for a reader at the 5th grade level. For my personal taste I would prefer my YA to be a little older and have more nuance to the characters and higher stakes for my protagonist.","Wed Mar 20 23:45:43 -0700 2013","Wed Mar 20 23:54:59 -0700 2013","Fri Mar 08 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",1,0,"False"

 I like it overall but the ending kinda ruins it for me with him getting an award just for being him, which is, from what I've read & listen, many people with disabilities are tired of. How his friends suddenly changed and started calling him ""little dudes"" for being picked on by students from other schools also leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's as if August isn't a person to them, but since August is from the same school and he looks weak, so they have to protect him somehow. 
 At first I thought the story will be through August's eyes only, so I was surprised to see that the book switches to other character's POV. Though I really find Justin's POV to be distracting with no capitalisation and proper punctuation. I also don't feel like he's that interesting as a character. I mean, unlike Miranda, Via and Jack, he was never mentioned anywhere through out the story to make me interested enough in him, so it was surprising to see him as one of the POVs in the book. Still, it wasn't bad and I guess the book needs an outsider's perspective on the Pullman family. I really love the part where Justin talked about how the lotteries are balanced though. 
 4 stars because I can't say I don't enjoy it. It's just that around the last part of the book is kinda too cheesy even for me.","Fri Jun 09 02:58:59 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 09 03:09:04 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 09 03:09:05 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 in my case, i'm the only one in my school (and in my neighborhood too) who has a genetic disorder called, Mandibulofacial Dystosis. Sounds cool,huh? Yah, i hope it's a disorder who can make me look cool too. But, anyway, i am different. and this time, it's not a good kind of different. 
 The thing about being different is, it'll determine people's action toward you. 
 If you are the good kind of different, you will attract people to you. Like a lamp attracts moths. 
 But if you are the bad one, it will keep people away from you. Like you're a skunk. 
 But, the worst thing of all, which sometimes i can't stand is, people always stare at you. Sometimes they do that when they think i don't see them and look away when i see them, but sometimes they do it right on my face. They make those horror faces while holding their breath. (Well, sometimes it does look funny though..) 
 That's why i always hate to go to the crowded place. The more people there, the more eyes are starring at me. 
 So, i really have no idea what got into me, when i said yes, i want to go to the normal school. It's like i am a lamb who voluntarily ask to go to the slaughter. 
 You know sometimes, middle school can be as cruel as the jungle (i'm in the fifth grade,by the way) 
 Everyone try so hard to be in the highest place of the food chain. You'll eat or be eaten. 
 In my case, i can't choose. Just say, i'm a permanent resident of the lowest part of the food chain. And in my whole life, i have to run in order not to get eaten. 
 But there's also a ""hipsters"" group, who choose to be in the low place of food chain although they can be in the higher place. Like my friend Jack and Summer, they're like a vegetarian lion. 
 The middle school was not EASY. Really, believe me it was damn hard. It's already hard even when you don't have any facial deformities and a genetic disorder. But when you do.. yah, just try to be one. 
 But, different from the jungle. In the human world, everyone deserves a second chance, even the cruelest one. Because sometimes we all loose our way now and then..i understand. 
 The good thing about being me (believe me, there's a good thing) is you can see clearly that miracles do happened. 
 i have several miracles around, like Jack and Summer. I also have my mom, my dad, via, miranda, and via's boyfriend, Justin. And of course i had Daisy. 
 Like Justin said, 
 ""the universe takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. the universe takes care of all its birds."" 
 -------------------------------------------------------------- 
 I can hardly remember if i ever cried that much..well, okay i cried a lot when i read Five People You meet in heaven, and when i watched Facing the Giants, and don't forget the fault in our star and Marley and me.. and gosh, how could i forget how much i cried when i watch i am sam? 
 ... 
 geez,i AM that sensitive. 
 but really, i never knew that i could cry that much.. 
 this book tore me apart, crushed my heart and hurt me right in my lacrimal gland. 
 usually, i cried at the middle of the book when i already emotionally bound with the character or the end of the book which become the ""most favorite times"" for the writer to kill all lovable characters. (grr) 
 but, this time, i already wept a little at page 9. and cried hard at page 40 something..arghhh :'( so, brace yourself.. 
 I could say that i've been in almost all of the characters' position. 
 I've been the ""anomaly"" 
 I've been the one who hates the ""anomaly"" 
 and of course, like most of us, I've been in the neutral side who try not to take a side. Because that's the easiest. 
 so, when i read this book, i recall some names and emotions. and i realize that no one.. NO ONE deserves to be treated like that. Even if you and some people do deserves it, but you'll always be sorry one day and wish you had never done that. 
 actually, we all different from the other, that's how God created us. And i'm pretty sure the reason is not to bully each other.. #graahsusahnyagacurcolpasnulisreview 
 now, WARNINGGG!!! spoiler time!! 
 what i loved so much about this story is, there are several point of views so we can understand all of them very well but it's not as confusing as other multiple POV books. 
 and i don't know why but, in the middle of the book, i really look forward to hear from Miranda's point of view. And see? it's never been easy for her too. 
 i like that she didn't write from the mother's point of view. I don't know why, but i think i already can imagine how sentimental it will become. But, i do want to hear from Auggie's father side. 
 And i do love Justin's point of view. i don't know what's the purpose, but she wrote Justin's pov without any capital and direct conversation. But, i do like him with his Tic disorder. 
 ah, but all the characters are so lovable. I love Via, Jack, Summer, Miranda and mr. Tushman. Yes, i hate Julian, but yah, everybook should have a jerk like him..And yes, i hate his parents much more than him. 
 Among all those tearful moments, i found a moment which i cried much harder than the others. It's when Darth Daisy died. oh goshhh, i really couldn't stop crying. i'm a forever dog-lover, so it's a tear-tsunami moment for me. 
 but, there's also a really good moment here. I love when Auggie laughed at people's reaction when they see him, and his jokes with Jack. I also love the ending. 
 it's a really really great book, people.. you really should read it. It gives you the idea of how cruel life is but how nice a man should be. 
 i'll give it 5/5 
 and people ,let's standing here to congratulate ourselves, because..

The blurb made it sound special, but how special I had no idea. I can tell you now it is one of the most special stories I have ever read. 
 August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a genetic defect that changed his face. He and his family are perfectly aware of the attention he attracts, and the decision to send him to 'outside school' for the first time in Grade 5 was not taken lightly. This is the story of Auggie's life through middle school, and it is an unbelievably inspiring, life-changing journey. 
 The narrative is told from different points of view, which makes the story more real for all kinds of readers. Not everyone sees Auggie in the same light, and each has their own way of coming to understand and love him. Via has been through a lot as August's elder sister, and though she's one of the most generous, loving sisters ever, the pressures of high school are taking their toll. But for her brief moments of weakness she more than makes up with a determination to start over that makes this story inspiring and relevant for every teen. Justin, Via's new boyfriend, is an easy-going, down to earth character, yet somehow his simplicity allows him to perceive things at a deeper level than most. I love his thoughts about whether 'the universe' was really unkind to Auggie Pullman, and his conclusion is perfect. That page titled 'The Universe' would make a profound stimulant for discussion. Summer is one of those extraordinary kids who observe with their heart and are not afraid to act. Jack is every kid who has cause to regret a friendship bungle, and who, in the process, learns so much about the kind of person he wants to be. Miranda, Via's old friend, perhaps has it hardest of them all, and her difficulties seem set to ruin her life. Yet she is one of the few who have always seen Auggie as the wonder he truly is, and because of him she finds her way home. 
 Others' points of view are interspersed with Auggie's own, and it's beautiful to see his character grow: what a transformation from the beginning to the end; what a lot he has to go through. Initially he shows us an excusable frustration with his condition and people's reaction to it, and his middle childhood growing pains are so much more acute than those of others. Like Via says, ""My worst day, worst fall, worst headache, worst bruise, worst cramp, worst mean thing anyone could say has always been nothing compared to what August has gone through."" But more than this, we see the strength of his loving family which nurtures in him the qualities that make him so special: courage, kindness, friendship, character, helping him become someone truly great, someone ""whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own."" Those last few chapters which include Mr Tushman's speech would make another inspiring discussion. 
 Somehow the genuineness of Auggie's situation naturalises all the advice the reader is given. There are references to all of my favourite books: The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, my favourite line from Shakespeare's Hamlet, and one of the most profound quotes from Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and all the quotes are meaningfully connected with the characters. I won't spoil the power they have in the story by relaying them here, you just have to read it. And then there are Mr Browne's 'precepts' which are a kind of motto for his class to follow each month, another great idea that is subtle but so effective, you'll want to memorise the full list at the end. 
 After reading the book I wanted to find out more about the author. Who is the person who can write something like this? What I learned from her blog only made me love the book more. Her last note of thanks went to ""the little girl in front of the ice cream shop and all the other ""Auggies,"" whose stories have inspired me to write this book."" She said that there were passages where she cried while writing it, and gives a moving account of reading it to her own son. This is a person I would like to know. www.GoodReadingGuide.com 
 ""That's how it is in heaven. It's just love, and no one forgets who they love."" 
 ""Do people look the same when they go to heaven, mommy?""

 ""Then how do people recognize each other?"" 
 ""I don't know, sweetie. They just feel it. You don't need your eyes to love, right?"" 
 ""no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. like with parents who adore you blindly. and a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. and a little gravelly-voiced kid whose friends have left him over you. and even a pink-haired girl who carries your picture in her wallet. maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds.""

Simply fanttastic. I listened to the audiobook version and I love that each ""voice"" in the book was narrated by another person. 
 The premise of the story is simple. August has a facial ""deformity"" (bad term I know). A very bad one. His family and friends are able to look past it and see his radiant personality shining through but the same can't be said of everyone else. Kids call him a freak, parents stare, people run away. Needless to say, young Auggie has to deal with a lot. Especially, now that his parents are encouraging him to attend school for the first time in his life. Because of all the major facial surgeries Auggie has always been homeschooled by his mother, but now that he doesn't need any surgeries for a while there is no real reason for him to stay him. Obviously, August can think of a lot; kids will make fun of him, he won't make friends, people will say mean things, etc. In the end he decides to give school a try and it is nearly as bad as he thought it would be but he decides to tough it out. Slowly but surely he starts to make some friends. This is their story. Told alternately from the viewpoints of Auggie, his sister, his school friends, and others. This is a tale of kindness and seeing the best in others. It will make you laugh, cry, be angry, and view beauty in a completely different way.

 I do feel that the author could have made the book much more complex and nuanced. The subject matter was unique, but the story itself was relatively bland. Lots of reviewers have said they bawled while reading this--I didn't really find it to be that emotionally charged. I cry easily when it comes to fiction, and I didn't shed a tear for this one. 
 But it was a quick read, and I'd still recommend it. This one would probably actually work well with its intended middle grade audience as well (as compared to, say, A Monster Calls, which is brilliant but might be somewhat inaccessible to kids despite the supposed intended audience). The simplicity of the narrative, which bothered me as an adult reader, might be ideal for younger audiences.","Sat Feb 18 16:11:32 -0800 2012","Tue May 15 08:27:14 -0700 2012","Mon May 14 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Sun May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,"False"

 The second time reading this book was still pure magic. The lessons in this book are so important to know. With social media, in some cases, we have lost our ability to empathize with people. This story is such a safe haven for me. 
 This is a story for anyone who has felt marginalized for their identity, race, sexuality, etc.. It is a story showing the beauty and power of always choosing to be kind. 
 OLD REVIEW: 
 This is such a beautiful book. 
 The writing is beautiful. The characters are fully realized and interesting. The way the narrative is structured is really unique. The story is told through multiple perspectives all set within one school year. 
 It was well done because there was never any confusing between perspectives and none of them were boring. In fact, I wanted more from other characters like miranda, summer, and jack. I love these characters and the message that this book has. 
 I almost shouting for joy in the end because it was amazing to see Auggie's transformation. 
 Read this book! 5/5!","Tue Jun 14 21:59:18 -0700 2016","Sat May 13 17:34:43 -0700 2017","Sat May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Thu May 11 00:00:00 -0700 2017",1,0,"False"

 Wow. I think everyone needs to read this book. What does it mean to be kind? Auggie Pullman is going to school for the first time. Fifth Grade. Middle School. But he's not like other kids. He has a sever craniofacial defect. Auggie exhibits bravery and strength throughout this book. More surprisingly, he is able to change the way people think of him because he is kind despite the way he looks on the outside. 
 This is a great book. Every 10-12 year old should read this book, and adults too. I read this book after my rising 6th grader read it from his suggested reading list. Don't judge someone by the way they look on the outside. Give people a chance based on who they are on the inside. That's what counts. And even Julian learns his lesson in the end. So good!

His story chronicles being the outcast to becoming the hero. Auggie Pullman is the kind of character you can and want to root for. 
 The book was written in first person and separated into eight sections. Each section focused on one character with the first, last, and 6th section focusing on Auggie. I liked the sections on the other characters, but I really liked going to back to August as the narrator. The other sections allowed the reader to see things from other characters points of view and how they related to Auggie. It helped form a bigger picture than just what was seen through Auggie's eyes. That worked best for this story. 
 Overall, it was a captivating story. I felt Auggie's pain as well as his joy and triumphs. He has to deal with situations in ways other kids don't. Due to his facial deformities he's an outcast. People stare at him. People treat like he's got cooties. They don't want to touch or be near him. But, he inadvertently shows them they're wrong. Some learn. Unfortunately, some don't.

I didn't think the dynamics of the school were very believable (most of the kids read too old to me, and the way it all worked out in the end was just TOO warm-n-fuzzy)--I think that was my main problem--and while this is way, way better than most guidance-counselor fiction, the writing did creep that way too often for my tastes. 
 The big action scene near the end didn't work for me. I'm assuming there really are environmental education schools in New York where one of the evening activities is getting together to watch a movie in a park, so while I thought that was really strange and it didn't make sense to me, I give that a pass. But... logistically... there were a bunch of things in there that puzzled me. 
 Perhaps most of all, the ending was both too feel-good and a little creepy. I was really uncomfortable with how we're supposed to think a school full of kids calling Auggie ""Hey, little dude""--including kids his own age--was a great thing. Better than before? For sure. But so icky and condescending. All the kids thinking it's so great that Auggie won this school award? I mean, I don't think kids care about awards like that all that much, and even if they did, I would have expected more grumbling (""they only gave it to him because"") than admiration. 
 I liked that Julian never came around. That felt real to me. But I didn't like that he just won't be in school next year, problem solved. 
 My favorite narrator, and the one that felt most real and natural to me, was Via's boyfriend Justin. I love that guy. I would like to say that I wish we'd gotten more of him, but I think it was probably a wise choice to give us just a taste and leave me wanting to know more. Likewise with Miranda. 
 The scene at school that felt the MOST real to me was the one where Auggie is in his Halloween costume and hears his so-called friend talking about him. The kids' voices in that seemed spot-on, and I took what Jack said quite seriously and alarmedly. But then it was never really dealt with. The scene was, sure. But it seemed to me like it was kind of passed off as ""I didn't really mean it"" when at the time Auggie notes that he sounds very serious. I mean, Jack says he thought a lot about what he would do if he was in Auggie's situation, and I think that IS the kind of thing a kid would think about. I don't think he made that up on the spur of the moment. Perhaps further talk about suicide would have made the book too dark for its audience, but I felt like it left me hanging with something very serious. 
 Overall: I think this has too many holes to make it a Newbery. And ""Mom, thanks for making me go to school"" (not an exact quote) sums up my philosophical problems.","Fri Apr 06 07:43:50 -0700 2012","Tue Jul 03 07:25:50 -0700 2012","Mon Jul 02 16:19:53 -0700 2012","",5,3,"False"

Even though most chapters are through August`s eyes we also get to read the points of view of his sister, Via, her former childhood friend Miranda, her boyfriend Justin, and August`s new friends Jack and Summer. I liked most of these chapters, but maybe we didn`t need all of them. Especially the part with Justin seemed a bit redundant. On the other side Via`s chapter definitely brought an important layer to the book and most of the other chapters did too. It is so easy to judge everyone for their behaviour and reactions towards August but showing their points of view makes it a lot more difficult. 
 I think this book is important, well-written, easy-going, funny and beautiful all at the same time. As an adult reader I sometimes missed a little debth and severeness to the story but this is a book where older children are the main target group and it is also told through children's eyes. It certainly has it's tougher parts though where you get both angry and sad, but the heart, the smile and the hope is there all the time. For instance Auggies parents makes the story about his rather dramatic birth into a comedic story about a farting angry nurse and he wants to hear it over and over. I also did find myself thinking if children and some adults really could be this mean and ignorant and unfortunately they can. This is an important lesson for me as an adult and parent, to remember exactly how mean children can be without even realizing it or at least not thinking about the consequences. For children and I guess all of us this is also a story about the importance and value of being kind to each other. 
 These last few days after I read Wonder I`ve found myself really missing August. He is such a beautiful and strong character with the optimism and curiousness only a child can have. This little boy could definitely teach most of us a thing or two about life and what`s really important. He is a complicated character but not as broadened, cynical or deep as an adult nor should he be. None of the characters that tell the story are adults and inside these frames the story really works. When life is good, it is all happiness, and when it's not it's devastating. All that in between and ahead are for adults to think and worry about. 
 I read this book in norwegian as it was a gift from the norwegian publisher Gyldendal. I am happy about owning this book in norwegian because I`m looking forward to give this to my daughter to read when she is ready. The norwegian publisher has published this as more of a YA-book but I think it is mainly for older children. That being said this book could and should be read by a large group of people age not considered. I still think it's important to say that this is a book suitable for children from the age of 9 I think. The author says on her web page that adults have a stronger emotional reaction to this book because we know life is not going to be easy for little Auggie later on but children find the story mostly funny and uplifting. Despite it all Auggie has a family that loves him and gives him whatever they can and he also has friends that got his back, and that's more than a lot of ""normal"" children can say.","Fri Nov 23 04:29:09 -0800 2012","Mon Nov 03 10:45:22 -0800 2014","Mon May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Wed May 08 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,0,""

 We see most through his eyes, though two of his friends, one enemy, his sister and his sister's friend all get a chapter or two from their point of view. 
 Palacio does a marvelous job of giving us insight into the emotions and minds of them all - the fear, the ordinary, the slow acceptance of getting used to the abnormal to see the real person, that people for the most part aren't mean or bad, just need a bit of time, the humor, the pain, the joy, the pleasure.

 It was a good, quick story about bullying and accepting yourself. The only issue I really had with it to be honest was that there wasn't one true storyline. It was just based on a year. The year was the first time Auggie went to public school (5th grade) after being homeschooled his whole life due to the multiple surgeries he had. Auggie's face had facial abnormalities that caused his face to be ""deformed"". 
 What I liked about the story was that you get to see everyone's perspectives. Auggie's perspectives. The people he met in school. Summer. Jack. His sister's perspective. Her boyfriend's. Even his sister's ex best friend Miranda. You know whose perspective I would have loved to see? Julian's. The main bully's. I'm pretty sure when I finished the book I saw that there was a book made with other character's perspectives that weren't included. Maybe one day I'll read it. 
 As we're talking about perspectives, I do want to admit that I had an issue with Miranda's. In some ways, I can compare her to Julian. Saying what she needs to say to get/be popular. I'm surprised her big fat lie that Auggie was her brother didn't get blown up, especially at the play. 
 I don't understand how the turn-around happened. But then again I can. Auggie is always and truly so authentically himself that that kind of stuff gets contagious. He wasn't malicious to anyone and never wanted to get anyone in trouble regardless of the wrongs done to him. And I think it was definitely cool how the guys who once used to talk about him and make fun of him were the ones defending him on their field trip. 
 It's easier to be kind and accept someone than to hate them. Kindness is such an admirable feature in anyone's personality and it takes so much effort to hate/bully someone. I think this was what R.J. Palacio was trying to show as well in her story. I couldn't quite tell if this was meant for a younger crowd. Any one of us could learn a genuine lesson in reading this book.

When he decides to finally try it, he is filled with fear and doubt about his first day, and every other day after. 
 The characters in this book seemed so real! The events were very well described, and I especially loved the way the book was written; it had different point of views. August, his sister, his two best friends, his sister's boyfriend and his sister's ex-best friend. Like this, the reader can understand each character's situation very well, and they can also understand their motivations. 
 The only thing that annoyed me was the way it was written when it was the sister's boyfriend who was narrating because there were no capitalization and no quotation marks when someone was speaking, so although I understood, it took me a little while to adjust to the way it was.","Tue Jun 07 19:37:39 -0700 2016","Sat Jun 25 08:08:14 -0700 2016","Sat Jun 25 08:08:14 -0700 2016","Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,"False"

 I enjoyed the switching point of views, it really let me see how August's medical issues impacted the people around him. I loved the theme of change and adjustment throughout the book. I switched between schools a few times during my younger years and I remember how difficult it was to come into a new school and not be very good at making friends. Of course Auggie had it much worse but I found that I could really emphasise with Olivia as she struggled to find her place in high school. 
 The characters' struggles were realistic and I really liked that the author didn't gloss over the more difficult parts of their lives, such as Olivia's hesitance in being known as the girl with a deformed brother. 
 I think that this book would be really great for younger readers and honestly, there should be more books like this readily available to children. I really encourage teens and adults to pick this book up as well, despite it often being regarded as a children's book.

I did also like that this didn't descend into August being bullied, or is miserable in school, and distances himself from his family. There wasn't a major romance part played either, which tends to be a fixture in young adult novels. 
 August had never been to school before, but having had numerous surgeries on his face, it is going to be more difficult for him to fit in. 
 I liked The Cheese Touch chapter. I was shocked by the thought that people wouldn't touch August purely because of what he looks like. 
 The part where he overhears classmates talking about August, 'If I looked like him, seriously, I think that I'd kill myself.' was shocking too, at the cruelty of it. 
 Alien was also a chapter that upset me as well, as August again has to defend himself against the callous ignorance of children older than him, asking, 'What is that?' 
 With various narrators in parts of this book, it gives a total view of how people see those like August, including his sister, Olivia.

The point of view starts with a young boy of ten years of age who was born with a rare disfigurement and lets us know that he probably looks worse than we imagine. He goes by the name of August and he is strong willed and incredibly strong minded. I found myself crying so many times at how brave and strong this young boy was through so many trying times. He explains that he has never stepped inside of a real school, only to begin the journey soon enough. 
 As August goes through his days inside of the life of a real school kid, he learns to deal with the name calling and shunning that he knew would happen. What I didn't know was that we would get to experience lives through the eyes of many of Augusts friends and even his sister, telling their side of the story and sharing in their experiences and beliefs of August. 
 In the end, things came together quite like they should. Unfortunately, it was over certain circumstances that never should've taken place. Wonder is full of compassion, heartache, and love.

 I thoroughly enjoyed August's narration. He had a realistic approach to how people saw him. 
 At first, I was disappointed when the point of view shifted to his sister, Via. However, it was a good change of perspective, especially to see what it was like growing up with someone who commands so much attention. This goes for August's friends, Summer and Jack, as well. I didn't care for other points of views, like Via's boyfriend and Miranda. I would have liked to hear from a teacher or the bully, Julian, instead. 
 My main complaint is over the ending; it finishes too perfectly. The scene at their graduation seemed more fitting for a movie than a book. August is winning a medal for what exactly? The children in his class haven't learned kindness through him. instead, they've learned how to pity and protect the ""little guy"" rather than value who he is. August does gain the acceptance he craved, but not for the right reasons. And suddenly Julian is out of his life and Miranda is back in Via's and everything is peachy? I don't buy it. 
 Overall, this is an enjoyable read with a sympathetic, albeit young and therefore occasionally whiney, protagonist. The book would earn a 4.5 or 5 stars if it weren't for the ending.","Tue Jul 02 02:46:08 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 17 15:59:05 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 17 15:59:05 -0700 2013","Fri Jul 05 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,"False"

I am not going to dispute that possibility because I wholeheartedly agree with all the hype. I loved this book. I loved Auggie and his courage in facing public school for the first time. The courage it took for his parents to send him to public school knowing he would likely face poor treatment by some. Auggie's sister's struggles with feeling overlooked and wanting attention for her own abilities and concerns rather than receiving attention simply for being Auggie's sister. The format of the story (multiple viewpoints) gives the reader more depth as far as what other people are thinking and feeling and what Auggie is thinking and feeling. For me this made for a book that was truly heart wrenching at times. There was more than one occasion where I wanted to hold Auggie in my arms and just love him. 
 I thought the way the author told the story from multiple viewpoints was brilliant and makes for a great book for teachers. The main theme of the power of kindness shines through bright and clear, and yet the author never says it directly, she just shows it beautifully through the words and actions of the characters. I've read a few criticisms that the ending is too idealistic and maybe it is to some degree, but then I think of actual news stories I've read about such things and then no, I don't think the ending is too idealistic. In fact, I love the ending. For me the really powerful part of the ending is not that Auggie's problems have all gone away, because they haven't and certainly unkindness can be found almost anywhere, but that Auggie has grown into a stronger person, as have those closest to him, and after all, isn't that what life is about? Being the best person we can be. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.","Sat Aug 11 22:51:20 -0700 2012","Sat Aug 11 22:52:03 -0700 2012","Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",2,1,""

 This is very fortunate for the reader because an ordinary ten-year-old kid wouldn't have captured my heart the way Auggie did. While this is marketed as a YA novel, this should be on everyone's to-read list. I wasn't expecting this to be told through various perspectives, so when it jumped out of Auggie's point of view, I didn't know what to expect. Luckily, I fell in love with it. I feel that Auggie could have carried the story but, by using the others, more depth was added to the novel - much like real life. We often see things in our lives through our own lenses and struggle to understand others' motives. Sometimes we are lucky to read a book that reminds us that everyone carries their own struggles through life. We shouldn't be so quick to judge others because we never really know what they are experiencing that they might not want us to know- no matter how close you may have been to each other. Each person carries their own story until it blends into or out of Auggie's life. This story is so convincing that I wanted to walk into the school and meet Auggie. Great writing, beautiful story, and this review will never do it justice.

 In her astounding debut novel, Palacio's ""Wonder"" illuminates on the importance of acceptance and self-discovery at an age where we are still trying to determine who we are and where we fit in the world. Following the lives of Auggie Pullman and those close in his life, this coming of age novel truly uncovers the trials individuals go through when the world appears against them. A true work of art, ""Wonder"" will take you on a roller coaster of emotions within the first few pages of the novel. Will Auggie discover what true friendship is? How will the characters cope with their inner turmoils? 
 --May Contain Spoilers-- 
 I picked this book as part of the POPSUGAR Reading Challenge, for one of the challenges is picking a book which has a film coming out in 2017. I had a good feeling about this book before I even read it by the reviews, the aesthetic of the book cover, and the story it had to tell. 
 Palacio's ""Wonder"" impressed me far beyond my original expectations! I finished this in a day and was devastated when it was done simply because I wanted more! Books like this make me tremendously happy that I'm a book reader and that authors like Palacio exist! 
 This book touched me in ways that I haven't felt in a long time from a novel. One minute I was full of smiles... then I was in absolute tears...then I was furious...then I would end up hysterically laughing. There are so many important life lessons to take from this novel, I feel as though this should be a mandatory read in elementary or high school English curriculum's. I had a hard time staying objective in this review, but I hope that the little snippets of my own experiences further emphasize how wonderful this novel really is. 
 Okay, let's get on with this review. As a forewarning, this review contains minor spoilers... 
 The story is about August ""Auggie"" Pullman, a boy born with a facial deformity that is now entering school for the first time in the 5th Grade. Throughout the story, we are introduced to a number of obstacles Auggie must face. Bullying, discrimination, self-doubt and loathing, isolation...Auggie's trials are definitely a handful for such a young boy. However, it's through these battles that Auggie begins to learn more about the kind of person he wants to be and how beauty comes in a number of ways. His optimism and strength are such inspiration, you begin to feel a sense of encouragement to find the light in your own life. 
 However, Palacio not only focuses on Auggie's story but of his friends and family. His sister Via's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to the family dynamic, his friends Summer's desire to seek the beauty in the world and Jack's inner turmoil with knowing what defines true friendship, Via's boyfriend Justin's introduction to a world he is not accustomed to, and Miranda's struggle with family identity are just a few of the challenges the characters face in Palacio's extraordinary novel. When I say it's a roller coaster of emotions, I truly mean it... 
 In order to execute this properly, Palacio uses multi first-person narration to place us further into the lives of all these characters. I'm not typically a fan of multiple narrators, but I don't think ""Wonder"" would have been as remarkable if it was only in Auggie's point of view. It's through this narration style that readers are able to fully grasp how characters are feeling with their own challenges. 
 One POV that resonated with me the most is Olivia ""Via"" Pullman, Auggie's older sister. Via loves and accepts Auggie in the most beautiful and touching way imaginable, caring and protecting him in the best way she can...but she's not perfect. In her new high school, Via struggles with friend changes and for once wanting to not be the girl with the ""facially deformed brother"". She wants to be seen as a normal girl with a normal family, which causes her immense guilt and anxiety. Coming from a household with a brother who's been diagnosed with low functioning autism, I completely felt her pain and cried along with her. It's content like this that makes ""Wonder"" a magnificent piece of literature. Palacio doesn't sugarcoat it...she unmasks the truth, uncovering the good and the bad and the ugly sides of humanity. 
 What I found even more brilliant is the change in writing style as the narration switched. Each character has their own voice, making you really feel the changes in the characters. Palacio even went to extremes such as changing the sentence and grammatical structure to emphasize the character change. I felt so much more connected to each character's' story due to small details such as this - her writing is truly genius. 
 Palacio's ""Wonder"" is by far the best piece of new literature I've read in 2017. Personally, I find it so hard to read books about people with facial deformities or with special needs or with physical disabilities. It's not because I find these topics too much, but because I find many novels don't truly demonstrate what it's like to live in a life with one of these difficulties. Having Ty (my brother) in my life, it's hard to acknowledge a number of books as good pieces of literature for the stories are so pretty and happy. It's not always pretty and it's not always happy...everyday has a challenge to overcome and sometimes life just gets messy. Palacio acknowledges these parts; she demonstrates that even family members like sisters aren't always the perfect sister, parents don't always have all the answers, and people in society are not always nice and accepting... 
 But what I truly loved is the emphasis on how there is more beauty in the world than darkness. 
 ""Wonder"" shows what one small act of kindness can do, changing the motion of the world. Humans are funny creatures, full of grand surprises. Palacio highlights on this through the remarkable friendships Auggie makes and the beautiful family dynamic of the Pullman's. Life is truly beautiful, especially when we learn to look beyond ourselves and the physical world. This novel shows there's no such thing as purely good people and purely bad people - we are all imperfect beings in a very imperfect yet magically wonderful world. If the story alone doesn't pull you in, the abundance of beautifully written quotes regarding life lessons and inspirations will definitely provide you with joy. 
 If Palacio's ""Wonder"" is not already on your TBR list, I strongly encourage you to add it and read it as soon as you possibly can. It's a charming, fast-paced read that is a joy for all ages.

Unlike August though, I began school in kindergarten (and attended daycare before that) so the students in my class were used to me. That didn't make my time at school any less difficult but it did mean that most of the students in my class didn't stare at me. 
 Palacio wrote Augusts' story from different perspectives (his older sister, her boyfriend, his friends from school, his sister's friend) and I felt like that was a nice twist on the story. I often forget that my older sister went through her own difficulties (well I don't forget, I just remember always being hurt when she wouldn't do things with me). 
 August has real concerns about attending school and he takes most of it the way I took it (I either ignored it or made a joke of it). I used to wear leg braces in my primary years and so on top of having a facial deformity, I wore leg braces so I totally understood why August was so upset about having to get a hearing aid. Something so insignificant can be a big deal. 
 The author did not spare the main character heartache and challenges which I think is so important because she knows his whole life will be that way. There will always be challenges to overcome and some will seem like the world is crashing in around you and others you will want to take a running leap at for all the excitement but the thing is, those challenges happen and you move on from them. Life goes on and that is what I took from this book. 
 I was lucky, I was able to have a surgery (I had to wait till I had stopped growing) and things were better. There are still challenges that make me want to hide in my bed but like August, I persevere. 
 I give Wonder 5/5 stars because it was a spectacular read.

The premise was solid, the voices are strong (but maybe they weren't so distinct as they could have been), and the plot was fine. Well, maybe it was the plot that bothered me. There was nothing original. Child goes to school, child meets difficulties, child overcomes difficulties, child is met with glory and friendship and love and recognition for all of the difficulties that they have overcome, we leave with a feeling that the hard part is all over for our friend Auggie and that he'll have smooth sailing from now on. And that's not the way it works. Life is hard. Not just in middle school, not just for August and his family. 
 I don't know what it was. Maybe it was the voice? Maybe I am just looking for a look at disability/difference that is unique. I kept feeling like I was rereading Out of My Mind by Sharon Draper. A facial disfigurement and cerebral palsy have almost nothing in common except for the obviousness of the special treatment, the physical 'difference' between them and everyone else. So why, why, why, why, did these two books read the same way? There is no reason for them to. Disability and physical scarrings are as diverse as people themselves are, there are millions of ways to tell that story. So find a new way to tell that story. The racial struggle of stereotypes and such has been told and retold thousands of unique ways, even if we narrow it down to black vs white in the United States. So find a way to treat this issue originally. What I really think the problem is twofold: 1-this is an under-covered, under-written-about topic, so the moral is still way to close to the surface, and that is getting in the way of the story. This read like a didacticism. 2-There's no personal element. I don't get the drift that this subject is personal to the author. I feel like the author was trying to write a book that would succeed because it is ""important"" and deals with big issues. Love and acceptance and nonjudgement and taking care of your own. Good, important wonderful themes, but they were elbowing their way in front of the characters and the plot, which is not okay. 
 Now off the literary stuff, and onto reviewing the actions of the characters: 
 My first problem was the self-dubbed ""center of the universe"" problem. Via, in her first sentences of narration, accepts the fact that she is living in a house that revolves around August, and that she, understandably, resents that in the tiniest portion of her self. Why did she keep backstepping and excusing herself. We understand. Those are completely normal feelings to have, Via. Anybody who has ever had a sibling, ever, understands you to a certain extent. Another case of the author treating this issues with kid gloves. Why isn't it okay for Via to feel a little resentful of her brother? Because he's Different-with-a-capital-D and Special-with-a-capital-S? He's a PERSON. It is okay for her to feel mixed emotions towards him. He's not a paragon, he's a person. And so is she. If the moral of the story is that Auggie is no different than anyone else and should be treated as such...wait. That totally wasn't the moral of the story. I nailed the problem. The problem is that August, and a lot of these other protagonists such as Melody in Out of My Mind, are put on a pedestal. ""Their challenges are much much harder than anything any of us 'normal' people will ever experience ever, so they deserve a medal just for surviving."" The end of the book put August up on a literal pedestal with a medal. (I love Auggie, I really do think he is a great character.) THe whole book acted like August was, not only the center of the universe at home, but also at school. THis author seems to think that the introduction of one student to a school will unalterable change everything -social structure, attitudes of teachers, everything about a school. August is adorable, but one person doesn't make that much of a difference on three hundred 12 year olds. A bullying war that lasts all year long based off of one person's behavior. It just isn't the way middle school works, sorry. (disclaimer: if Beecher Prep was meant to come across as a much smaller private school, this part would not be relevant. A class of fifty could definitely be impacted/divided/affected to such an extent by one person. I've seen it happen. But that would be the authors fault for not explaining that better) 
 Numero Dos Problema. I know it was the first year he was well enough, but the ""at middle school, they'll all be the new kid, it'll be great"" reasoning is seriously typical-adult flawed. Like, top six bad ideas. Can we all agree that the issue with August going to school is not that he is New, it is that he is DIfferent. This stuff is so much better controlled in elementary school. In elementary school, you have one cohesive class, one teacher who knows you and knows all the students and knows how the students work together. Any kind of ""bullying war"" or hostile group dynamic could be diagnosed and then lectured out of them (in elementary school, kids actually listen to their teachers) The teacher could have helped Auggie and just, everything would have been so much better. SO much better. It physically hurt me knowing that August just had the bad luck to live in a place where fifth grade is middle school (Seriously? where is that! I was in seventh grade and I was hardly ready yet. I'd like to speak to these fictional administrators) and to have his parents run on such flawed reasoning and lack of real (read: talk to children) research and infocollecting. It hurt me knowing he could have been hurt so much less, entering the already-hard middle school years with a support system. ah. 
 I am glad this is middle-grade viral. It is an Important book. I just wish it were also Well Written and Original. :(","Sat Mar 01 10:02:11 -0800 2014","Fri Aug 01 20:12:14 -0700 2014","Thu Apr 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Wed Apr 02 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"False"

 Wonder, a middle grade book beautifully written by RJ Palacio, is the story of a little boy who was born with facial deformity that prevented him from attending schools or from having a normal life and so he was homeschooled. Even after numerous surgeries, that didn't change much, he still freaks out kids and makes adult uncomfortable. Auggie's parents wanted their child to feel as normal as they could, so they decided that attending school is their next step, and the book is Auggie's experience with being exposed beyond this parents' shield, just like a fish taken out of water and into the real world where people don't know him and already judge him by the way he looks. 
 Palacio wrote a masterpiece that years from now is gonna be taught in school just for the wonderful morals and message it send. As sensitive and depressing the main idea may sounds like, Wonder is actually a joyful, cheerful piece of art. The characters in the book were mostly children and shows the way children are pure hearted and haven't been polluted by the judgmental, brutal world around them, yet there are other kids who has already followed adults into wrong routes and inherited wrong morals. Auggie had to encounter people of both worlds. 
 As you progress in the book, you'll realize how, actually Auggie's look didn't matter to him or people he knows and love, because the see him for what he is and not what he looks like. Auggie was a smart kid and knew how people see him and knew how people avoided looking directly at him for too long and he perfectly understands how people reacts to his presence, cause he is a self-aware character. 
 Palacio drew a stunning novel with marvelous writing style that suit all ages. The characters felt so vivid and layered which added a lot to the divine plotline. 
 As for me, this book was a turning point in my life, it taught me a lot of morals that I still act upon, it taught me to never judge a person by the way they look because that's so irrelevant and cruel. That no matter how horrible one's situation is, by a little optimism and a sprinkle of hope that everything will eventually be okay as long as you believe in yourself and others. It showed me how beautiful it is for someone to reach inner peace.","Thu Sep 08 07:49:24 -0700 2016","Sun Sep 25 13:24:58 -0700 2016","","",7,0,""

""'Shall we make a new rule of life...always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary?'"" Here Mr. Tushman looked up at the audience. ""Kinder than is necessary,"" He repeated. ""What a marvelous line, isn't it? Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed. Why I love that line, that concept, is that it reminds me that we carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness. And what does that mean? How is that measured? You can't use a yardstick. It's like I was saying just before it's not like measuring how much you've grown in a year. It's not exactly quantifiable, is it? How do we know we've been kind? What is being kind, anyway?"" He put on his reading glasses again and started flipping through another small book. ""There's another passage in a different book I'd like to share with you,"" he said. ""If you'll bear with me while I find it...Ah, here we go.

On the surface, it's a small gesture. But to this young man, whose name is Joseph, it's...well, if you'll permit me..."" He cleared his throat and read from the book.

It glimmered in their kindness to him, it glowed in their keenness, it hinted in their caring, indeed it caressed in their gaze.'"" He paused and took off his reading glasses again. ""It glimmered in their kindness to him,"" he repeated, smiling. ""Such a simple thing, kindness. Such a simple thing. A nice word of encouragement given when needed. An act of friendship. A passing smile."" He closed the book, put it down, and leaned forward on the podium. ""Children, what I want to impart to you today is an understanding of the value of that simple thing called kindness. And that's all I want to leave you with today.

Wonder was hyped by many friends and others on social networking sites, so I was excited to discover it in the media center at the middle school where I work. I had some ideas about what would take place in the book, and most of my predictions were correct. As with any books, people are moved by many different things. As I read Auggie's story, I began to wonder if others felt the same way I did. As an educator and parent, I have always been moved to help students and my son become the best they can be regardless of situations that come upon them. This book reminded me that all my efforts have not been in vain. I especially loved August's relationship with Daisy and how she loved him unconditionally.

 Today, I just finished Wonder. It's not so often I'm this moved by a novel. The book makes me want to be a better person. Although I miss the characters already, I'll remember them always. 
 Masterful book about bullying, compassion, true beauty. The story is about Auggie, who has a facial deformity and goes to a regular school for the first time in fifth grade. But the story also follows other important characters' stories. Each person has a distinct point of view and a unique voice. Their stories overlap in a way to bring us a complex, thought-provoking, and beautiful book.

Wonder fits that niche perfectly, its deceptively simple narrative veiling a myriad of depths and insights. 
 Wonder is mostly about August (Auggie) Pullman, a 10 year old boy with severe facial disfigurement. Auggie has already been through a multitude of painful operations but his latest experience could well be the most challenging - going to school. He's been home-schooled up until now and sheltered from the curious and insensitive eyes of society at large but hopefully the three mentors chosen by Mr Tushman, the principal, will ease his transition. 
 What follows, in a series of short chapters, is an account of Auggie's experiences at Beecher Prep, narrated by Auggie himself and, in other sections, by his sister Olivia, his friend Summer, Olivia's boyfriend Justin, her friend Miranda and Jack who was chosen to be a guide/mentor for Auggie. The language is simple but the feelings examined are complex - what does it feel like to be different in a world which has such a limited view of beauty/attractiveness? What is it like for the siblings of someone who doesn't fit the norm? Isn't it really difficult to tread the ""middle ground"" and neither ignore nor stare? Auggie represents anyone who doesn't fit in and all our associated hang-ups when we strive to be politically correct but fail miserably. 
 There will be those who avoid this book as it sounds like some preachy manifesto and I fully understand their reticence. Yes, there is a moral message, basically, ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind"" and yes, I know it sounds didactic but this isn't Mitch Albom territory and there is no deliberate pulling on the heartstrings or straying into schmaltz. Having said that, we could all learn something by having this little peek into Auggie's life, and perhaps adult readers have the most to learn from it.","Sat Mar 17 07:34:31 -0700 2012","Mon May 21 14:45:53 -0700 2012","Fri May 18 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

About looking deeply inside to understand who we are and deciding that, for most of us at least, there's a lot of room to be better. 
 Having both a disabled brother (deceased at 21) and disabled daughter (alive and kicking at 34), I could completely identify with the emotions and stresses of every character except Auggie.

 This book is written mainly through Auggie's point of view however at times we are treated to the point of view of his sister and a couple of his school friends. We get to see how Auggie has affected their lives both in a positive and negative aspect. 
 I was unable to put this book down and read it in just a couple of hours. One minute I would find myself laughing along with the characters and the next moment I would find myself wiping away the tears. This book certainly takes the reader on a rollercoaster of emotions. 
 I found myself able to relate to Auggie in a sense. I was bullied throughout school, I was that awkward kid that wore glasses and liked to read and I feel that this is one of the many reasons that this book appealed to me so much.

 Auggie can't help but notice and be hurt by how other kids, his teachers and total strangers react to how he looks. No wonder his favorite holiday is Halloween, when he can be treated like any other kid. 
 The book changes viewpoints as it moves along, giving the viewpoints of Auggie, his sister, the kids who befriend him, and others. Each character is written with depth and honesty and feels like a completely separate person with their flaws and observations.

Once in a while, I read something and realize that not all hope is lost for children's and YA literature. This book actually reminded me of the books I read as a middle school student just a decade ago, especially Paul Zindel's The Pigman or Hinton's The Outsiders. Do these books even exist anymore for the next generation? Few people even in my generation were still reading them. 
 As great as popular series such as Percy Jackson are to encourage kids to read, sometimes I think they need to start reading more fiction that doesn't pull any punches about how life can be - especially the kids who are already raised in a bubble where their parents see to their every need and they're only exposed to other kids who are similar to themselves. What I do see instead is books that you think are ""realistic"" because there's death involved, such as The Maze Runner, are set in such fantastic circumstances that most of the emotional impact seems to be lost on the kids. It's really good to know that there are still actual books like this that appeal to young readers, rather than what I see in the Scholastic catalog sent home from schools - Buy the mockingjay pin! Buy this Minecraft 72 page ""book"" with a toy! Buy this detective ""book"" that comes with a cheap plastic magnifying glass and invisible ink pen! At the end of the day, kids don't need gimmicks when there's a real story. 
 I wish all schools had teachers like Mr. Browne or administrators like Mr. Tushman. But even if kids don't hear it from the adults in their own lives, that's the magic of being able to pick up a book and jump into someone else's life.

His support is also exemplary. He was physically challenged at birth but he was also blessed with a loving, supportive, and realistic family, his parents and sister Olivia (Via), who not only see and treat him as a whole person, but come to be treasured by Auggie's and Via's friends, too.

 As an adult who has long worked with youngsters around Auggie's age, and having first-hand experience with unique appearance and with children with unique appearances, I came away from this not only having loved it myself, with the firm conviction that Wonder is a terrific story on its basic level, but more, a book of values underneath that youngsters will absorb to their benefit, values like the role of externals in seeing another person, the role of kindness, the roles of patience, authentic love and caring, and more than a bit of what goes around comes around.

 It's books like this that can inspire an empathetic world. It doesn't have you connect with the main character alone, but it shows you how deformity affects everyone around them too. ...I wasn't expecting that. But I'm glad it did. The main character wanted nothing more than to be normal when no one could see him that way. It shows how too much kindness and coddling can be almost as bad as fear. It mainly focus on fear of course, but it will have you analyze what is appropriate. Kids aren't stupid. They know when you are overcompensating and that knowledge can help everyone take that step further into open-mindedness. 
 The only downfall was that the humor was a bit too young for me, but it's hits the demographic head on and that is far more important - so I'm not letting it affect my rating. Plus it's still cute, I just felt that the main character got more laughs out of it then I did. 
 Honestly, if that is the only criticism I can find, then that is a wonderful sign.

This is a book about bullying, but also about hope, friendship and family. And it's a good book, featuring a believable and interesting protagonist you simply can't help but relate to. 
 August ,,Auggie"" Pullman has been born with a cleft palate which left him with a facial deformation, influencing his hearing abilities and scaring a lot of the people he meets away. After being homeschooled for quite some years, at the age of ten, Auggie's parents finally decide to allow him to enter middle school - leading Auggie into the beginning of a new chapter in his life, a chapter in which he is going to be confronted with friendship and the darkest sides of bullying alike. Entering this novel, I didn't know that cleft palates occure in 1 to 2 per 1000 births in the developed world - the subject of the novel is certainly a very strong and important one, a subject people should be confronted with because, after all, there is still too much bullying in this world. 
 Palacio structured her book in a very interesting way by including the viewpoints of several characters. After allowing the reader to get used to Auggie's voice, we meet his sister Via, then one of Auggie's friends at school, Summer, afterwards another classmate called Jack, then Via's boyfriend and finally an old friend of Via, Miranda. All of them were characterized by unique voices ... a method I didn't approve of at all. Why does an author need to write entire chapters without capitalization and in fragmented sentences just to underline that the character doesn't seem to care about grammar and how to express oneself properly? It was annoying and a struggle to read, as were the Facebook chat messages between two characters, which mainly consisted of messages like ,,can we b frenz agen?"" or ,,awsum!!!!"" by characters who talk in their own point of view chapters sophisticated enough to appear capable of using the English language without butchering it. It is simply contradictory when the author writes about one character in his very own punctuation, but then writes inconsistently about the voices of others. 
 If you don't want to be spoiled about the ending, then please don't read the parts I marked as such. Don't say I didn't warn you. 
 The ending is happier than a novel with such a dark and depressing topic should be allowed to be. Reminiscent of successful movies like ,,Shawshank Redemption"", this tale dealt with serious topics and then allowed the topic hope to take over the style of the story. But in comparison with Shawshank, ,,Wonder"" didn't conclude on a bitter-sweet and realistic note, it simply cried out ,,Here is your happy ending!"" and ,,Be happy about it!"" I did care for Auggie and was happy to realize that in the ending he had his own touching and amazing moments. But it took away a lot of the realistic aspects from the beginning, because when does a story actually end on such a happy note in real life? Remember that this is simply my personal opinion, but I thought that a more subtile conclusion would have been more memorable. The way it was written, this simply appeared to be like another school drama, even in spite of all the serious topics which were attached in the beginning and the middle part. 
 Some time after the release of Wonder, R.J. Palacio published another chapter with the point of view of Julian, one of the kids who bullied Auggie in school. Not even Goodreads seems to know how to deal with this story, as there is one edition of Wonder with more than 160,000 ratings (the one I am reviewing right now) and then another edition with 110,000 ratings which includes the ten pages from the Julian chapter. Until a few weeks ago, those two editions were combined in a single book, yet now they have been divided into two different books on GR - which is confusing as hell. (Edit: As of October 2016, the two editions are combined as one single edition again.) Anyway, I gave the other edition two stars because of the way Palacio tried (and for me, obviously, failed) to excuse bullying. Julian was revealed to have suffered from nightmares about scary faces in his childhood, which made him feel like Auggie is just another monster - thus his awful behavior towards him. I don't doubt that something like this might happen in real life, just as, after all, there is no excuse for bullying. It was the way Palacio sounded as if this was to redeem Julian's character which confused me and ultimately made me feel like having some negative experiences in one's childhood makes up for plaguing someone who isn't even responsible for the way he looks. 
 This is a book loved by almost everyone, and they are all right. Believe them. I'm just this weird reader who almost never likes those books which have received all the attention in the universe.

My just finishing second grade daughter chose it at a book swap last weekend, so I swiped it and read it in a couple of hours to make sure that it was appropriate from both reading level and thematic perspectives. The reading level was fine for my precocious reader, and I didn't find the book disturbing - instead, I found it, on the whole, to be very sweet. The premise of the book (horribly disfigured boy named August enters fifth grade at a nearby private school after being homeschooled his whole life) is, of course, sad, and August has to grapple with identity issues and some bullying, which some parents might find off-putting; I did not. It's written well, and Palacio integrates multiple perspectives into the book by switching up the narrator a number of times - a stylistic approach that, in my opinion, is difficult to pull off successfully. There is a strong cast of vibrant characters throughout the work, and the love and affection within August's family was touching. 
 Overall, this is a solid novel for mature elementary school audiences and beyond. It offers lots of opportunities to talk with your child about the importance of compassion, empathy, and love; it doesn't shy away from the fact that there are many painful elements present in children's lives, which I appreciated. I strongly recommend it for its target audience but didn't find it particularly illuminating as an adult, although I know that it has been on the best seller lists for ages and touted as a book that adults and teens will find engrossing. The three stars are my reaction to the book, which might be a bit unfair; a kid would likely give it at least four stars. For me, though, not surprisingly, I felt that the novel lacked sophistication and had an altogether too tidy happy ending.","Sat Jun 14 20:55:18 -0700 2014","Wed Jul 02 20:04:34 -0700 2014","Sat Jun 14 00:00:00 -0700 2014","",0,0,""

 Wonder, by R.J. Palacio, is a beautifully written story proving that kindness should be given to all and integrity is earned through consistent actions; that the greatest courage can most definitely come from those from which society may least expect it. 
 Multi-layered, complex characters offered their unique point of view into a variety of situations. Through Auggie's strength, others blossomed. Palacio developed her secondary characters beautifully, allowing them to gradually become more comfortable with Auggie. She did not pretend that they were perfect, but instead made them real. Individually, they made mistakes, but grew together.

The characters, the book cover, the story totally won me over. Auggie was born with facial deformities that required much of his young life to be spent in hospitals. Not that he wasn't smart, but he just was never able to formally attend school since he was in and out of hospitals having multiple surgeries. Now he's entering 5th grade, and the middle school he is attending has never seen anyone like Auggie. Yes, he's smart and kind and funny, but many people have a tough time getting over his physical deformities. Even his sister, who loves Auggie, is afraid to admit that he is her brother because she is afraid of what her friends might think. Auggie knows he's just a normal middle school kid (aside from his face), but it's tough to get other kids to understand that and get beyond his physical appearance. 
 Readers will love Auggie and will be rooting for him and for others in the story to get beyond his physical deformities and see him for who he is. Such a well-written and thought provoking story. As angry as I got at the bullies and other who gave him a hard time, I fell in love with the fellow students and principal and others in the story who were able to get past what Auggie really looked like and saw him for the great kid he was. Each chapter is told from a different person's perspective, and really gives insight as to how each person in his life is thinking. I highly recommend this story for girls or boys in grades 4-7.

 The first day of school can bring forth many feelings - excitement, anticipation, dread, nausea, etc. It is especially difficult to walk through the hallways if you're the ""new kid"" with the added pressure of adjusting to new environments, teachers, and classmates. Now imagine having to go through the ""new kid"" initiation as a ten-year-old boy normal in every aspect except the one that counts the most for first impressions: appearance. 
 R.J. Palacio's Wonder stars August Pullman, a boy born with a genetic mutation that has resulted in various facial deformities. Homeschooling was the only way to keep August on track while he had countless surgeries to correct these deformities, but as the first day of fifth grade draws near, his parents agree that it is time to give mainstream schooling a shot. August is understandably against this decision at first, but after a visit to Beecher Prep, the local middle school, he accepts his fate and shows up with the rest of the boys and girls his age on the first day of school. Wonder chronicles August's experiences during his fifth-grade school year, which span from extremely heartbreaking to incredibly uplifting. 
 Despite his abnormal experience, August is just like any other ten-year-old. He loves Star Wars, video games, and his dog Daisy. Mentally he is just as capable as other kids his age. Yet gaining the acceptance of his classmates is complicated by the fact that it is almost impossible to initially see past all his facial deformities. Kids are afraid to even touch him (a horrible game called The Plague spreads which requires anyone who comes in contact with August to immediately wash themselves). And yet, as the school year progresses, so does the maturity and humanity of August's classmates as they begin to see the real August beneath his mask. 
 What I enjoyed most about Wonder was that Palacio approached the situation from various perspectives. August's voice is obviously given a large chunk of the narrative, but readers also hear from his sister Olivia, his friends Jack and Summer, Olivia's boyfriend Justin, and Olivia's friend Miranda. While August has to walk around with his deformity every day, other people are also affected by his misfortunes. His sister's needs have been constantly overshadowed by her younger brother's. His friends take a big risk by accepting the school ""freak."" These alternate voices add even more depth to the emotion that August's story produces. 
 Children and adults alike could learn a lot from Wonder. It is a story of facing your fears, standing up for those you love, and learning to accept those who are different from you. August Pullman proves that it is never easy overcoming obstacles, but it is possible with a little bit of courage and a lot of help and support from those around you.","Wed Feb 15 19:09:19 -0800 2012","Thu Jul 23 13:17:00 -0700 2015","Wed Feb 29 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 -0800 2012",1,0,"False"

 Wonder is a beautiful, emotional, funny story about a boy that find his place in the world 
 We are introduced in this story with August, who loves star wars, playing at the playstation, reading fantasy books, sound like a normal kid. But what makes August different or extraordinary, is his face. He was born with a genetic anomaly, that caused a deformations of his facial characters. Even after a lot of surgical operations, he still doesn't look ""normal"". August knows that, he knows how people avoid looking at him and stare when they think they are notice, he knows they call him monster, he knows that people will always judge him first for his appearance; what it doesn't expect is to now people who will see beyond it. 
 When August as to face his first year of middle school, leaving the protection of his parents and home, he will be pushed out of his comfort zone, having to face the stares, whispers and ostracism that comes with been the new kid - only ten time worse. 
 The story is well written, having a simple style and good peace, changing the different point of view. It tends to be a bit too simple-minded pushing to an happy ending that in the reality of things could have been just slightly done. The kids in the book feel at times unrealistic, their behavior is to mature for their age. But given the light and funny mood that the writer wants, it's quite understandable. It reads on his own, it would do for a great middle-school read. 
 For me it was the first time reading about the Treacher-Collins Syndrome, I was happy to find an entertaining book that could also push me to be more curious about a subject that we don't commonly discuss. 
 I would highly recommend it to any middle and high school kid, but also adult, we are able to be worse than kids sometimes, we should stop be afraid of what's different and start trying to better understand it. 
 They are also going to do a movie adaptation of the book, to be released around april 2017 in the U.S.A

August is born with severe birth defects and is going to public school for the first time. This book is about the people he meets there and the ways they react to him. Many of the reactions are what you would expect, but there are a few that are rather surprising. The messages to the reader are sweet and great reminders of things that most people need reminded of. 
 Even though this is a book for children, it would be a great read for the whole family. I would especially recommend it to children with some sort of a disability or to someone going to school for the first time. 
 The ending makes you want to hug everyone you see because of all the feelings that are evoked. There are good and bad crus in this book, but it is mostly a feel-good story.","Wed Apr 05 07:39:47 -0700 2017","Tue May 02 20:29:25 -0700 2017","Tue May 02 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 This book has gave me so many feels, apart from August the main character I empathised most with was Via, his sister. The fact that she feels that she is put to the side since August was born and how she can never feel like her own person. 
 This book is more than just about a child with a facial disfiguration, it's a book about family, friendships and how everyone views the world differently and everyone is unique. The book addresses bullying in the best possible way, making it easy to see who the bullies are and how you don't have to mean to hurt someone to hurt them. 
 I completely recommend this book and wish that it was required reading in schools as it instils such a feeling of how humans should be.","Tue Jan 31 14:36:09 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 31 14:36:40 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 31 15:19:41 -0800 2017","",1,0,""

 I really liked the family dynamic, and I really felt for his sister Via. We don't get a lot of her, but we see how the attention Auggie gets affects her, and I really liked seeing that. I'm not sure if I could have handled an entire book from her perspective, but I did like the small bit that we do get in the book. 
 I also liked how real the characters felt. How they acted- what with The Plague thing, and the stares and stuff, I can see that happening in real life. How one of the moms acted was horrible- she photoshopped Auggie out of the class photo, and acted like he didn't belong in school, just because of how he looks. And it was really hard to read, because, theoretically, she should know better. But clearly not, and it makes me wonder if her son acted the way he did because he learned it from her. In the end, the other kids ended up being pretty okay, except for the one. 
 There is something I have mixed feelings about, though, and that's Auggie himself. I liked that he sees himself as a normal kid, and that he's not special or extraordinary, just because of how he looks, even though people around him probably think he's special because of how much he accomplished, and all of the surgeries he's had to endure. On the one hand, I liked that the book mentioned the fact that he was born with a cleft palate, which led to a lot of other health issues for Auggie, but didn't focus too much on it. But at the same time, I wanted a little more about it, because the book hardly goes into it. 
 Another issue I had was the fact that the characters seemed a lot older than 10. The way they talked and acted...it didn't mesh well with the fact that it's middle grade. It was really disorienting, and if 10 year-olds are, in real life, dating the way some of them seem to be dating in this book, I'm a little worried. 
 The book was also super-positive, which I get, considering the target audience, but it made the book feel too perfect, like nothing gets to Auggie (even though it must), and that everything will work out just fine, no matter what. It felt too simple, for something that could have had even a little more complexity to it. It's not for me to say that Auggie is too well-adjusted, because I've never experienced what Auggie has, and I have no idea what it's like to be in his position. But it was also something that was a little off-putting, just because I wanted something that seemed a little more realistic. 
 My Rating: 3 stars. I get why people loved this book so much, and I do like the message of not judging people because of how they look, and that you should be kind to people. But it was too simple, and too perfect, and I wanted something a little more complex and something that was a little less perfect.","Thu Jun 02 18:32:54 -0700 2016","Sat Jul 16 22:05:23 -0700 2016","Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,"False"

Starting WONDER I expected an emotional story - and emotional it was. It is the story of August Pullman, a boy with an unique facial deformity. 
 So far he's never attended a regular school, but his first day of school in 5th grade is nearing. It was interesting to witness the process of socialisation and integration of Auggie into the class and seeing how other children reacted to him. 
 WONDER is told from Auggie's perspective, an utterly honest and brave little voice. Auggie's sister Via, his best friends and Via's friend share their views and reactions on current events and their relationship to Auggie, too. Overall WONDER is written in a very easy and authentic language. 
 Chapters are rather short and are oriented at Auggie's events, realisations or experiences. Familiar episodes alternate with Auggie's experiences in a new school environment, daily life scenarios and the blooming bonds of true friendship, acceptance and respect. 
 5/5 ***** WONDER - This is a story about many first days of school, moments of bravery and a small boy who shows unbelievable greatness. 
 Auggie is a truly wonderful boy. What he lacks in conventionally good looks he has in integrity and natural sense for other people's feelings and intentions. He is one of the most adorable MG characters, one who earned my trust in his strength after only a few minutes into his story.","Sun Jan 08 05:33:47 -0800 2012","Mon Jan 05 09:54:00 -0800 2015","Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 -0800 2012",1,0,""

But after I read this book I felt that I HAD to write about it. 
 This is the kind of book that makes you laugh and cry. It kind of reaffirms the faith on humanity. This book is about a eleven year old boy, August, who has severe facial deformation and his journey in a new middle school. The author employs a off handed, relay-type, multiple POV style, starting from August himself and it includes 6 different people. Although different fonts and the No-capitalization used in Justins's POV were a bit distracting, it made a great read. Funnliy enough I connected to Via's POV than August's himself. She is August's elder sister who sort of lives in August's shadow and starts repenting it. But at the same time she feels bad for feeling so. Olivia's POV made me connect to the story further. 
 Another character that is worth mentioning is August's English teacher Mr. Browne, who sorts of plays in the back ground. I think the precepts that he gives, shapes and uplifts the overall story. 
 Do I think the book is a bit too sweet, too preach-y at times? Yes. Do I think the villain is portrayed a bit too villain-y and August a bit too sweet, his parents and Mr. Tushman a bit too understanding? Yes. But it is the book which make me happy that everything ended well for Auggie, even though I know it might be a bit too far fetched in real life. This is the book that you go to when you feel a bit down. 
 Also my copy contained an extra segment containing Julian's POV which sort of tied up the story together and gave me a closure! 
 A solid four! 
 My favorite Quotes from the book: 
 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives"" 
 ""If every person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God.""","Wed Feb 22 02:56:23 -0800 2017","Tue Mar 21 22:52:41 -0700 2017","Tue Mar 21 04:12:34 -0700 2017","Sun Mar 19 18:26:43 -0700 2017",1,0,""

But as great as I think the bulk of the book was, as realistic as it was that August found a couple of good friends and many classmates were still jerks, it took a turn for the twee toward the end. 
 I liked the multiple POV, though I'd have been happier if it had just been August and his sister, but this may be because I'm more interested in the high school experience than middle school/middle grades.","Mon Jan 21 16:35:31 -0800 2013","Mon Jan 21 16:38:54 -0800 2013","Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",0,1,"False"

This is a big deal for a kid who's been homeschooled his whole life due to severe facial deformities and many surgeries. The book chronicles his fifth-grade year and how it changes him, his family, his classmates, and his community. 
 More than writing sensitively about a difference or disability (which it does well, a la Out of My Mind), or showing the effects on family members (Rules), this story became magical to me the first time it changed point of view. You hear overlapping versions of events to reveal the reasons that characters act as they do; or, as the school principal says, ""there are almost always more than two sides to every story."" 
 It was strangely thrilling to read a story with so many modern details (Bone, Star Wars, the Cheese Touch, KidzBop, UglyDolls, iPods, cell phones), but I wonder if these will date the book too quickly. (As an aside, when a character uses her phone to call her mom from the bathroom for a ride home from a bad party, saying 'don't ring the bell, just text and I'll come out,' I spent several minutes thinking about this and how getting out so gracefully would have been impossible pre-cell phones.) I loved Auggie's strong, loving, functional family. So many kids' books are about dealing with one's crappy family that this was refreshing. Also, the depiction of bullying in middle school seemed dead-on. This, plus the short chapters, unique format, unusual protagonist, and (perhaps slightly too) happy ending, make this a ""tolerance"" book with actual high kid appeal -- a hard balance to strike, for sure. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""I don't know if the three of us found each other because we were so alike in so many ways, or that because we found each other, we've become so alike in so many ways."" 
 ""My mother is the kind of person who has a happy face for the rest of the world but not a lot left over for me."" 
 ""'Shall we make a new rule of life...always try to be a little kinder than is necessary?'"" --J.M. Barrie","Tue Mar 27 10:16:35 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 08 13:13:08 -0700 2012","Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",3,1,"False"

Like many other great novels - due to its strength however, it transcends and easily surpasses the confines of its genre and limited target market. The characters are well developed and not stereotyped, the plot line well-constructed - nice character illustrations too. 
 The main character Auggie has a condition - a rare medical facial deformity (variously described as a facial anomaly, craniofacial difference, mandibulofacial dysostosis) and whilst this is central to the story, on another level that particular issue is almost incidental. This is a story about growing up; it's about being different, lunchbreak and classroom politics. It's about self-acceptance against all the odds, it's about perceived 'otherness' and the consequential bullying. So when I say that Augusts' facial anomaly is almost incidental, what I am trying to say is that this perceived otherness and the associated challenges as a theme for the novel could have been one of many things chosen from a sadly all too long list encompassing so many other aspects including - race, gender, size, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, religion, culture, nationality... 
 The message from this story - being that growing up is hard and that otherness or being 'different' can make things much harder. An important issue also raised here is concerning 'deformity' being misunderstood and wrongly equated with disability or 'special needs'. Often and as in this instance - Auggie has no disability and no 'special needs'. 
 This is an important and thought provoking story. Palacio tells us that 'Wonder' is a ""meditation on kindness - on the impact and transformative power of kindness"". 'Wonder' is a moving and uplifting story of kindness and acceptance - sadly though there will be many out there in life that aren't so lucky and so subject to both. For me though, ultimately and overall - 'Wonder' is about hope, faith in humanity and faith in the human spirit - there is good in us. Leaving us with the simple but obvious and important message that - it's not what you're like on the outside, but you're like on the inside and how you behave that counts. 
 When considering the current political climate on the world stage, where those with perceived 'differences' or otherness are all too often, far from being embraced - but on the contrary are being marginalised and demonised - to me this makes this kind of story is all the more important. 
 I will finish with two of Mr Browne's precepts: 
 'When given the choice between being right and being kind - choose kind' 
 'Be kinder than is necessary' 
 A random precept that has always stayed with me: 
 'Never judge a man until you've walked a mile in his moccasins' 
 And one of my own: 
 'Everyone is different, everyone is the same, different but equal'","Wed Oct 19 06:21:16 -0700 2016","Thu Mar 09 02:20:05 -0800 2017","Thu Mar 09 15:56:53 -0800 2017","Mon Mar 06 01:02:55 -0800 2017",44,5,""

What I did not like about the story was that it did not seem plausible that all of the characters, except one, reach this revelation.","Thu Mar 22 05:55:26 -0700 2012","Sat Jun 02 06:12:38 -0700 2012","Sat Jun 02 06:12:38 -0700 2012","Tue May 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

Born with facial deformities, Auggie has always dreamed of being normal because normal is average and normal is ""nothing special."" When Auggie's parents tell him that he has been accepted Beecher Preparatory, Auggie is terrified of the idea that he will go to school with kids he doesn't know; according to Auggie, it was one thing to meet kids when he was much younger since they didn't know any better, but, now, kids will know that he is different, which means he will be open to ridicule. Although Auggie and his father are against it, Auggie's mother believes it will be good for him since she is terrible at fractions and it's time that he gives middle school a chance and make new friends. Reluctantly, Auggie agrees to meet with the principal (Mr. Tushman), but he wasn't counting on a tour and meeting students from his class. Although everyone seemed really nice, Auggie knew they were freaked out about his face except for Jack Will. Charlotte was really helpful, but it was Jack Will who seemed genuine. When the first day of school arrived, Auggie was nervous and he new that people would react to his appearance so he kept to himself until Summer joined him at his empty lunch table. Is it possible that there are kids out there who don't mind his face? Even Jack Will joined them at their table so Auggie, for the first time in his life, had friends. Told from alternating point of views between Auggie, Jack Will, Via, and her friend, Justin, readers will learn how Auggie is not just special because of what he looks like, but how he makes people feel and just how challenging that can be for those who torn between wanting to be his friend, but are worried about what others will think. 
 What makes this story amazing is that it's a story for everyone. All of us, at one time or another, have known, or seen, people like Auggie and Julian. I have an older brother who has a learning disability so when Julian, and company, would say awful things about Auggie I wanted to throw the book across the room because I was soooo mad! I also wanted to cry my eyes out because all Auggie has ever wanted is to be normal, but, what also angers me, is that he IS NORMAL! This story conveys how fear of the unknown can have a very negative effect on people, especially when we don't teach our children to accept people for who they are and not what they look like. Honestly, who cares that Auggie's face is different, but, to a child, this is a life changing experience. If readers have the opportunity to check out, or buy, the special edition of Wonder (that has a chapter from Julian's point of view) it makes sense why he behaves that he does. However, his bullying is not at all acceptable and it's obvious where it comes from when his own mother demands the expulsion of Mr. Tushman for not following ""protocol"" in regards to Auggie's admission into Beecher Prep. Moreover, when Julian's mother said that Beecher Prep was not an inclusion school, I wanted to ring her neck. Another reason why this book is amazing is that Auggie has the most amazing support system, which, sadly, not all kids (like Auggie) have. Even with Via's outburst, she realizes that Auggie needs his family because everyone is so quick to reject him because of his looks. Lastly, I loved the dynamics of Auggie's friends and how most of the kids had evolved after the ""incident"" and how they got tired of Julian harrasing Jack and Auggie. This is a great story where adults and children can come together to not only talk about real tough issues like bullying, and tolerance, it is also about teaching, and learning, the power of empathy and kindness. This book is timeless and I can't wait to read it to my own children some day.","Mon Sep 22 12:20:38 -0700 2014","Wed Oct 01 17:32:09 -0700 2014","Wed Oct 01 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Mon Sep 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 August (Auggie) Pullman is just an ordinary kid (on the inside), who lives with rare facial deformity. All he really wants is to fit in, but when the first thing people do is judge you because of what your face looks like, it makes that wish almost impossible. 
 I was moved by Auggie's story - despite the challenges he'd faced at such a short age, he managed to remain sweet and kind. His perseverance and humor filled me with hope. His family unit, and eventually his friendships were so heartwarming that they made me believe the world is filled with people who care and support one another.

My own extreme case of ezcema and a host of other medical ""abnormalities"" and eight moves as a child meant that I could identify with Auggie as he faced a new school and had to answer loads of questions about his condition from friends and strangers alike. But I found myself understanding and even identifying with parts of other characters' stories as we'll, including Via, Jack and Miranda. 
 I will admit that this book took me a good 60 pages or so to really get into. The text is written like a ten-year old boy (or whoever is speaking, all of whom were children) speak and the chapters are only a page or two long. I found it jarring at first and difficult to really get into the story. Once I got over that, I opened up to learn the many lessons this book has to offer about empathy, perspective and kindness. I wish the author had done a chapter from Julian's point of view as Miranda's gave you an inside look at why she had been acting the way she was and helped you see that her meanness really was out of insecurity (a valuable reminder for kids and adults alike!)","Sun May 10 19:43:04 -0700 2015","Sat Aug 06 18:04:33 -0700 2016","Sat Aug 06 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 -0700 2016",2,5,""

 ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 I'm just going to start off with I don't ever read middle grade contemporary, let alone middle grade at all. Usually, if i'm reading middle grade, it's a Rick Riordan book. I don't think I would've picked up this book if it weren't for book club. Now, I understand why this book was always around on the internet and on displayed in any possible bookstore I'd go into. This book is talked about online entirely by all ages and I finally understand why. Wonder is a novel hat deserves a standing ovation for it's gift of letting anyone understand a young protagonist with Treacher Collins. It makes me so happy to know that young children can read this and learn so much from it. If you're not familiar with Treacher Collins, it's when the face tissues and bones aren't fully developed and so on. I'm not sure if my definition is entirely right, but you can always look it up. Our main character, Auggie, struggles with TCS and has had over 20 surgeries in his life so far. Due to that, he's been homeschooled all of his life and is finally going to public school in the 5th grade. This novel is told is the point of views of him, his family and his friends. It gives you a chance to experience the things that might go on in the heads of someone with TCS and their family and friends as well. Now, i've seen some pretty poor reviews on this site and I don't quite understand why. This novel is middle grade and is written for a younger audience so of course, the writing isn't going to be top notch and it's not going to read like a YA or adult. But, you still getting something out of it and I find that really important. I'd easily recommend this book to anyone, it had a heart warming message and easily made me cry of happiness near the end. It's one of those books that's going to sit in my heart.

There are so many things to love about this book; from the story to the characters to the symbolic cover. It's really well written and is now one of my favorites. 
 Here are a few things that caught my attention throughout the book. 
 The symbolic cover. When I first picked up this book in the library, the cover made had me thinking that the cover artist was aiming for something artsy. But it wasn't until I read the summary (and the rest of the book) that I understood the concept. The boy on the cover is Auggie and he was born with facial deformities. I love it! 
 The characters. The two things I look for in book characters are diversity and flaws. (I'm not a terrible person, I swear!) But Auggie's character is taken to a whole new level. Auggie's never gone to school before (because of all the surgeries he's had to have) and well, he doesn't want to. He knows that people can be cruel and judgmental and he doesn't want to go through that. I liked how the author included character development that really helped us understand Auggie better. The situations and problems that Auggie are put through are heartbreaking, but realistic too, so it makes the story much more powerful. 
 The other characters, his friends, his parents, his sister, they're all supportive of him and go through a lot too, which shows that they really cared about him. 
 There was one character I didn't like though: the bully. Yeah, no one liked him, because well, he was MEAN! You can guess how he reacts when he meets Auggie. *grumbles about bullies* 
 Short chapters! If you're like me and you're busy all the time, books like this are for you! With its short chapters, you can sneak in a page without having to stop in the middle of the chapter and having to re-read it because you forgot about everything. Another pro to this book! 
 In general, this book is a great read, whether you like short chapters or long chapters or different points of view or not. It's a great story with a great lesson. The characters are really diverse and unique and the character development is great!

 Wonder is no doubt one of those books that make your heart softer as you go on through its pages. I have went through a bundle of emotions during the short period of time I spent reading this heartwarming story. I cried, I laughed, I wondered, and I got mad. It was not only interesting because you were reading about everyday life and school battles through the perspective of a special kid; but you were also reading the perspectives of the people surrounding the special little dude, August. One of my favorite things about this book is that it gives you hope in people. It is true that this is a fictional story but I am quiet sure that there are people around just like those kind-hearted characters in this book. So reading a good story about those invisible people is like an affirmation that fills you with hope. 
 I loved the meanings that you get from the story either while reading and deciphering as you go or while you sit staring at the ceiling thinking about the last passage you just read. Again, this book fills you with hope and happy feelings, and my happiness increased with how the writer was successfully able to convey her own thoughts of how people change when they know people better or when they give things a second chance. It was clear in the way the writer talked about how the school environment ""shifted"" as the year progressed and as people got to know more about this weird looking little guy. 
 This book tells you that it is okay to stare because we are only humans and our eyes are only used to average looking scenes, we are not equipped with a set of eyes that easily and instantly adjust to the extraordinary. But, once you notice that peculiar individual be kind and weigh your actions and words.

Auggie was previously homeschooled due to facial abnormalities requiring many surgeries throughout childhood, so it's a big transition for him. As you can imagine, society very rarely reacts initially with grace. Strangers on the street are routinely terrible, and the kids at school are mostly awful. But Palacio also narrates from the POV of the Pullman family and friends, who share their very honest experiences meeting and befriending Auggie - keeping the reader challenged with their own uncomfortable feelings as well.

I don't read that many children's books to comment on that, but this book can easily have broad appeal to all age groups, even adults, so that is saying something. 
 I don't write plot summaries in my reviews unless there is a point to make about the plot. This novel is much more character based. The points of view of about 8 different people in the main character August's life are presented and this never gets messy. One character's section is written without any capitals to help distinguish his character as a young man trying to establish his identity. I don't like this kind of style but the section is short. August is a character that you almost wish existed so you could throw your arms around him and hug him. It's so refreshing to see a child who has tons of problems to face but faces them with the tremendous love and respect of his highly functional (!) family. They aren't perfect but this is a together family of the type that I think many people don't believe really exists today. (They do!). I almost hope the author will write a sequel about August dealing with the teenage years. 
 The central message of the book is an important one to bring out in these days: that it is important to be kind to all and that if you are kind, the kindness will eventually pay off even if it exacts a price in the present. IT's a good lesson for kids to learn and for adults to be reminded of. 
 The age recommendation on Amazon is 8-12 and while I don't see any content reasons why it would not be appropriate, the age range seems a little young as I would say the book is a little more sophisticated than that. August is 10 and in fifth grade but comes off as older than that. A mature eight year old with excellent reading skills, maybe but not all. 
 The ending is a little too convenient and that is the reason for the four stars instead of five.","Fri Feb 08 08:07:13 -0800 2013","Fri Feb 08 08:07:25 -0800 2013","Fri Feb 08 08:07:25 -0800 2013","",0,0,""

 August is one of those characters that I will probably never forget. I loved how he was kind of a Star Wars geek and when he was talking about certain characters or situations, I totally knew what he was talking about. 
 I was surprised that the book had different POVs because you usually don't see that in books that are geared for the younger crowd. I really enjoyed it because I loved hearing the same story that August was telling but from the other points of view like his friend Jack and his sister Olivia. The only part that was kind of weird and I tried looking online about it was the section from Justin's POV. It was the only part that had no quotes when someone was talking and it was written in all lower case. I loved all of the educators in this book, great role models. 
 Even though I work in a high school, I still bought this for my library. Yes, August is in 5th grade but I think this is a story that all grade levels need to be exposed too especially because of the whole concept of bullying. 
 The only part that I was emotional during was when August's dog Daisy died . 
 Overall such a great story and message too. I was rooting for August throughout the whole book.","Wed Dec 12 09:02:09 -0800 2012","Wed May 31 08:23:54 -0700 2017","Sat Apr 13 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Wed Apr 10 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,"True"

 It is both sad and happy and comforting - it both gives hope for humanity and destroys it. Kids can be as mean as they can be sweet when they are confronted with something they don't know, like August. 
 August is an extraordinary character, all while being ordinary. I'm not saying that because he has a mutation that made his face mal-develop. He is genuinely a sweet and fun kid! He has a Star Wars addiction, a few good friends, a loving family, and a good sense of humor. But people judge the kid by his cover and treat him differently because of it. Some people bully him mercilessly, while others befriend him like a normal person. 
 The book was written very simply, in a 'he-said she-said' way that made it a quick an easy read. It can really be read by anyone 10 and up, but with different understanding of the book, I think. 
 One thing I loved was the fact that there were 8 parts, most of which were told by a different point of view. His friends, family, and acquaintances tell their story about how their lives entertwined with August's, and how it changed them. (there was one part I didn't like much, which was Justin's, just because there were no capital letters or quotation marks... ;-; ) But they really each brought a new perspective to the story in a perfect way. 
 All of the characters were so unique and well thought-out. However, their backstories weren't what was important for any of them, it was really who they were as a person that was brought to attention the most. The little things they did for August, the way they acted with others, who they were as individuals... and I think that that's the main message form this book - people may have different looks, stories, and experiences, but it's who they are on the inside that matters most.

 August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school--until now. He's about to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances? 
 August Pullman is a typical ten-year-old boy. He likes sports, video games, and Star Wars. He is an intelligent kid. Like some kids these days, Auggie has been home-schooled by his mother, but his school year, Mom thinks it is time for Auggie to go to a real school. Dad does not agree saying sending Auggie to school would be like (sending) a lamb to the slaughter. 
 Mom and Auggie go to Beecher Prep to meet the principal, Mr. Tushman. Auggie ends up on a school tour with three kids that would be in his fifth grade class, should he attend. Julian, Jack Will, and Charlotte are nice and show Auggie most everything including the science lab, gymnasium, and cafeteria. Beecher Prep is an exclusive and demanding school. Kids take entrance exams just to be a student there. Unknown to Aggie, he has already passed the tests. 
 Fast forward a few months, Auggie is attending Beecher Prep and in Ms. Petosa's homeroom. Lucky for him, Auggie sits next to Jack Will in nearly every class. They get along great . . . until Halloween. However, Auggie did make a true friend in Summer, his lunch table mate. Fifth grade has its ups and downs. Most kids will not touch him, acting as if he has the plague or some other awful contagion. Aggie makes it through fifth grade and returns for sixth grade. This year will be the most trying year of his young life. 
 I really, absolutely, loved this story. Wonder is the debut novel from R.J. Palacio and she entered the children's lit world with guns a blazing. The characters are well developed and have distinctive voices. Nearly everyone has changed in some way by the end of the book, including the reader. She must have spent her days and nights around ten-year-old kids because the dialogue is spot-on. Good kid, bad kid, parent, teacher, or ""extras,"" Ms. Palacio has the correct, believable voice. 
 When I first saw the cover, I wanted to read this book. The pale blue background of a young kid with one eye had a way of drawing me to it. After reading the book, I think the cover is wrong for the book. Auggie has severe facial abnormalities including a cleft palate, eyes much to low on his head, and ears that are nearly non-existent. If the cover is suppose to be of Auggie, the designer missed it, big time. 
 Auggie is 10 when the book opens, having survived more surgeries, treatments, and therapies than most of us will ever experience, and is about to go to school for the first time. I remember middle school to be a game of who's popular and who isn't, only notched down a degree from high school. Add parents that are often as bad as, if not worse than, the kids and middle school becomes a place not for the timid . . . or the new, and definitely not for the noticeably different and possibly scary. 
 I think Auggie represents anyone who is different. He is the child fighting cancer that lost his hair, the kid in a wheelchair, or the one attending special ed. He is the fat kid, the nerd, the shy kid, and the kid without friends. Auggie represents all of us at some time or another. We all have or had a blemish or two, felt excluded, talked about, maybe even feared. August Pullman endures all of those, at the same time, from kids at a cruel stage in life, when being accepted and part of the group is extremely important. I think Ms. Palacio captured this realistically without being maudlin 
 At 320 pages, Wonder is still within the reach of middle grade capabilities. The chapters are short, easy to read, and the words simply flow making the turning of pages a pleasure, not a chore. The point of view does change every now and then. We get to read about Via, Auggie's sister. She tells us what it's like having a brother who rightly demands all of mom and dad's attention. Jack Will, who unknowing crushes Auggie with his sharply barbed words, tells us the friend side. Mostly though, it is Auggie we hear from and his trials being ""that kid."" 
 Wonder is easy to read, difficult to put down, funny, and sad. If you can read this story without shedding at least one tear, you did not pay attention to what you were reading. Do not let that scare you away. This is not a tearjerker; it is a thought-jerker. I think Wonder should be required reading for every middle grader and teen. Awards will accumulate and by the end of 2012, Wonder will be be one of the top ten middle grade books of this year.

 Hailed as the next The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, Wonder is NYC-based author R.J. Palacio's debut novel about a 10-year-old kid, Auggie Pullman, born with facial deformities caused by a genetic disorder, and his everyday attempts to defy the odds. You'd have to be a brute not to sympathize or at the very least root for Auggie. Of course, this assures that this book will be (and is) a real crowd pleaser, and reaches an audience that is broader than at first intended (Middle Graders), which in turn is very much like what Haddon achieved with his Curious Incident ... Very clever marketing indeed! 
 Both books of course, are sort of like the definite safe Oscar winners playing on everyman's sentiment and heart. That is not to say, however, that Wonder is a bad book. Not.At.All! But an honest reviewer looks past the sentiment and the cat, for one, thinks that Wonder is actually a good book but with definite shortcomings as well. 
 Up till now - the beginning of 5th grade - Auggie has been homeschooled by his mom. Now, though, his mom thinks it is time for Auggie to go to a real school (like ""a lamb to the slaughter"" his dad claims). At school Auggie is confronted with the myriad of ways in which the kids and the grown-ups look at him... the story of his life, unfortunately. As if starting (Middle) school for the first time ever wouldn't be bad enough in itself, Auggie has to deal with people having all sort of emotions when they see how different he is: from sympathy to pity to hatred even. Only a minority doesn't care what Auggie looks like and is friends with him regardless. Wonder is told from the perspective of 6 kids and Auggie's voice - clearly the focal point - is only one of them. The other 5 voices are often interchangeable, though, which is the cat's biggest reservation when it comes down to narration with multiple points of view. 
 R.J. Palacio - who in a former life was the designer of Paul Auster's book covers - hasn't written an earth-shattering novel with Wonder, but she deftly plays upon a human's capacity to care and to be outraged at the same time. As is demonstrated in the book, often it's not really the kids who judge a person's looks, but rather, the kids just have questions, and it's the adults in their lives who label and judge. Favoring kindness as the ultimate human value, ""when given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind,"" is actually the most important precept of this book - a precept the cat does not agree with, btw. If your book is written from that perspective, obviously criticizing it from a non-kind perspective, will make you seem...well, like a brute. 
 But favoring truthfulness over kindness, for the cat Wonder was a book about an incredibly important topic but the way this is dealt with is a bit too sugary and Disney for my liking. Everything wraps up too neatly. Characters also fall into the good-bad categories a bit too conveniently. And this is not cynicism and not about believing in the fact that literally everyone gets a happy ending.","Tue Feb 26 08:19:05 -0800 2013","Wed Mar 13 02:02:21 -0700 2013","Fri Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,"False"

The kids (ranging in age from 6 - 10yo) couldn't raise their hands fast enough to talk about the main character, August (or Auggie), his loyal family and his adventure in his first year (5th grade) in public school. 
 Told in first person from varying points of view, Palacio deftly brings us into the fold and sets us on a roller coaster of emotions as we feel Auggie's brave struggle to belong in a world that desperately wants to look away. The reader knows he's deformed from a birth defect with an unpronounceable name, but the author never truly describes what he looks like. This book is about being brave and taking chances, embracing differences and seeing beyond the surface of things.

 I was swept away by the characters and plot. 
 I was impressed with the utter rawness of this novel. 
 Honestly, I don't know where to go from there. I suppose that I could line it point form, in my classic way. 
 Pro: 
 1. The theme. It was amazingly well executed. In many more serious novels, the theme gets in the way of the story. In this case, the story is solid, and the theme builds it up. I loved that. 
 2.The characters. Auggie was darling. His humour, the lightness with which he took himself, and his general personality and cleverness was refreshing and charming. 
 Summer, as well, was a good character. 
 Jack. 
 Via. I loved her, actually. She seemed very real to me. It can't be hard having a younger brother with a craniofacial abnormality. 
 Those two things really sum up this novel. The only negative thing about it was the style in which it was written... at first. I didn't enjoy the seemingly sloppy formatting, but as the book continued, I gained an appreciation for the style. I wouldn't say it was my favorite, but it didn't ruin the book either.

 I'm not sure exactly how to rate this book. I bought it for my ten year old to read and when he couldn't get into it, I picked it up. Obviously it's a young reader novel and has good moral messages in it-which as a parent, I'm a big supporter of. I agree with several people's reviews-that the characters all sound alike-but isn't that true to life? Kids in the same school/social circle/families will pick up the same slang. I do have to say my favorite part of the book was Julian's added chapters. The stories from his grandmere and when Julian finally understood remorse. His ""oh I get it revelation.

Middle school is bad enough. Wonder explores middle school through the life of August (Auggie) Pullman, a boy with an extreme facial deformity attending school for the first time. 
 Unsurprisingly, days after I finished this novel (which has been getting some fabulous press for a while now) a screenwriter was announced for a movie adaption. I think this is a very strong and important story to reach a potentially larger audience. I also think the source material provides some inherent challenges for that adaption. For one, Palacio is purposefully vague about the exact nature of Auggie's deformity. This is a powerful tool. The descriptions are specific enough at times that it becomes clear the author has a vision. It's not a matter of half-formed ideas. Rather, our own imagination conjures up what is worst for us. 
 Wonder doesn't sugar coat things. There are always going to be Julian's (a particularly nasty bully) in life. I give Palacio extreme credit as well for exploring the idea that the parents of the Julian's of the world are the ones that help foster these ideas. Kids can be cruel. This is evidenced by Auggie's initial reception at Beecher Prep, including the idea that any student that comes into physical contact with Auggie has to wash their hands within a certain amount of time. This detail pulled at my heart and sickened me. It also forced me to attempt to recollect if anything similar went on in my time in middle school, because it didn't sound all that foreign. Did I miss the opportunity to stand up for someone, lost in my own loneliness and angst? And I think that's exactly what this book is supposed to get us to think about. 
 I did have a couple nitpicks with the book. I understand why Palacio used multiple POVs to tell the story, although I may have left some out, including the narrative's of Auggie's sister's boyfriend and best friend. Overall though, this seems like chump change to what I took way from Auggie's story. 
 Does Wonder pander to our sentimentality at times? Yes. But even Auggie recognizes that. More importantly, I would challenge almost any middle schooler to get through their 3-4 years with the strength and courage that Auggie demonstrates. He is an example, to those of all ages. What a beautiful reminder of what strength, character, and kindness really are, as well as the fact that we all can get through middle school. I can't think of a better time than middle school to attempt to put a little more empathy into the world. I would not be surprised to see this become an English class staple over the years. 
 And never forget, everyone deserves a standing ovation in their life at least once.

 This quote in Wonder made me think of the book, Team Of Rivals. I know... your going...huh? Kindness and politics? Civil War? Slavery? Huh? Not really an era one would mark with kindness. Strife, yes, but kindness? No way. It's not the plot that reminds me of the book, but the character, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln said that he valued kindness as a virtue in a person above all else. And he showed kindness to others. Sure he had other qualities. He was courageous. He knew that signing the Emancipation Proclamation was signing a death warrant. He was a storyteller. He had empathy. His kindness extended not only to friends, but to his enemies as well. He brought out the best in people. He chose kindness, when he could have chosen hate and power. He risked everything to do the right thing. 
 Meet Auggie Pullman. He too, is kinder than necessary. He too, chooses kindness over meanness, kindness over revenge, kindness over anger. And he's courageous. He stands up for what is right. He forgives his friends when they wrong him. He's a hero. But not your typical one. 
 Auggie was born with a birth defect that is so horrible he won't describe what it looks like because ""whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" He is going to go to middle school for the first time. He knows it won't be easy. He knows he has to be brave. He knows the kids will be afraid of him. But as his mom says, ""I really believe... there are more good people on this earth than bad people, and the good people watch out for each other and take care of each other. 
 Auggie doesn't meet very many good people at first. He meets a bunch of scared middle schoolers. In fact, they are so scared of him they have a game called, The Plague, where if they touch him they have 30 seconds to wash their hands. Auggie ignores most of it because he does have the two friends Jack and Summer. When Auggie overhears Jack say something mean he has to decide if he still wants him as a friend. As the students get to know him, he tries to ease their fears by joking about his looks. They find out he's a normal kid like them. 
 The story is told from several different viewpoints: Auggie, Via, Jack, Summer, Justin, and Miranda. For the most part this worked for me but I got pulled out of the story when Justin was speaking. The author uses him to make a minor point about Jack. This is the only time I set the book down and was able to walk away from it. When I started to read about Miranda, I thought, oh no... another Jack. But there is an interesting twist with her. I would have preferred Amos viewpoint over Justin's. Or Julian's viewpoint. Julian fizzles from the story at the end. I thought he should have gone to camp and something should have happened to give more insight into his character. He's pretty much the one-dimensional villain. If he had gone to camp the tension would have gone up a few notches. 
 Auggie has an amazing support system. When I first started this book I wondered if it would follow the story of John Merrick known as The Elephant Man. I remember watching this as a movie and Merrick suffered unloving parents and abuse. This story doesn't follow that path. This family is loving and struggles with Auggie's special needs. The mom and dad force Auggie to go to school and support him. Auggie's dad is funny. I love the humor he brings to the story. Via doesn't get the attention Auggie gets from her parents, but she's pretty accepting and understanding about it. It isn't until Via starts a new school that she has a problem with Auggie's face. She doesn't want to be known as the sister with the deformed brother. She just wants to be ""normal."" When she asks that Auggie not go to school for a play, Auggie blows up at the dinner table. 
 Some of the plot is predictable such as the camp and award ceremony. What isn't predictable is what happens during these parts. The ending has a great message about kindness and courage. We work to build kindness in ourselves, our students, our children. But it isn't always easy. Sometimes our paths will cross with jerks. Sometimes our choices can lean toward selfishness, power, or meanness. This story is about growing to be a better person. To be a kinder person. To be a braver person. To stand up for what is right.","Mon Mar 19 17:01:35 -0700 2012","Mon Jan 19 04:34:59 -0800 2015","Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 -0700 2012",9,2,""

But either way, it's a good book that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any adult, high schooler, or student in 7th or 8th grade. Honestly if I was still a 6th grade English teacher, I would highly recommend this to my students. 
 However, I've read posts in which readers are highly recommending this for upper elementary grades, as young as 8-year-olds. Let me address that first. The book starts with a 10-year-old Auggie, preparing to enter 5th grade, the same as my oldest son. The book starts off with potty humor and Star Wars references, so I thought, ""Yes! This is spot-on. My son will love this!"" And just as I was about to hand over the audio book to him and encourage him to read it, the tone of 5th grade dramatically changed. Star Wars was out. Hot girls were in. Dating, being popular, and an unsupervised party were the hip things. Whoa, I'm not denying that these things happen, but firstly I'd like to believe that they happen less than this book proports. Secondly, whether they happen this frequently or not, I'm going to choose to let my son live on in his sheltered perspective that 5th grade is for learning, having friends, and being a kid. 
 The only other ""problem"" I have with this book is slightly a spoiler. So I'll just say, it was more hopeful than a realistic story would play out. 
 One thing I quite liked was the book's references to other literature. 
 Oh and there's another thing that bothered me about the book. When Auggie is born--so deformed and fragile that the doctor faints-- the nurse proclaims to his mom, ""Every child born of God overcomes the world."" The quote is a Bible verse, I John 5:4 and the ""every child born of God"" refers to every person who ""believes that Jesus is the Son of God."" (I John 5:5) And in context of Scripture, it appears ""overcomes the world"" refers to obeying God's commands. (I John 5:3-4) In other words, this Scripture has nothing to do with Auggie's chance of survival. When Auggie reuses this quote at the end of the book, it is even more taken out of context.","Fri Sep 26 05:46:55 -0700 2014","Thu Aug 04 20:56:29 -0700 2016","Tue Aug 02 16:17:58 -0700 2016","Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

 ***** 
 For parents who are expecting a child (whether their first or not), normally what would they fear at that stage? 
 Me? When I was pregnant, my big worry is that my baby will be abnormal. deformed. I did not wish for a beautiful child, I only wish that he will be healthy when he's born. When I saw my son, not only is he perfectly healthy, but he is beautiful. whole. normal. so much more than the things i prayed for. 
 Auggie's parents were not so lucky. But despite his facial deformity, Auggie is as normal as it gets. he's smart, witty, and hilarious. I love Auggie! His personality just leapt from the pages and tickled my fancy. I thought this is a depressing story. It's not. Just a lot of reflections from a boy who just want to be remembered (and loved) but not because of his horrible-looking face. 
 I want to embrace his Dad! The most striking scene he has with Auggie is this. In two years, Auggie wore a helmet and never took it off. one day, the helmet has gone missing. 
 Oh, Auggie, don't be mad. I'm sorry. I just couldn't stand see you wear that thing on your head anymore, you know? i didn't think it was good for you. 
 Come on, Auggie, please try to understand, you were wearing that helmet all the time. and the real, real, real truth is: I missed seeing your face, Auggie. I know you don't always love it, but you have to understand... I love it. I love this face of yours, Auggie, completely and passionately. And it broke my heart that you were always covering it up. 
 What a WONDERful father. :) 
 You're gonna love all the characters here (well, except Julian, maybe). Wonder is heartwarming, heart-wrenching, heart-everything! 
 People can be cruel to Auggie almost every time. But he found comfort, love and triumph in his family, and his new friends. He never expected the universe will be kind to him. but it did.","Tue May 29 17:47:31 -0700 2012","Fri Jun 15 03:55:52 -0700 2012","Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Tue May 29 00:00:00 -0700 2012",7,0,"False"

 Few days ago I put the quotes from this book as my Quote of the Week and a lot of my friends here told me how they wanted to read the book. I was like...wait a minute I haven't even told you how lovely and heart-breaking this book is. So be ready to hear all about the greatness called - Wonder! 
 From the blurb you can see the story. We here have a story about August who well has a facial deformity and for that he has been noticed and looked at wherever he goes. Of course he knows that people are scared of him so he tries to spend a lot of time alone with his family. The things change when he starts going to the school. You can imagine how it is for a kid like him to enter the class full of ""normal"" kids for the first time in his life. Of course he is noticed not just by the kids but also by the teachers. He tries to cope with all that but at the end of the day he is just little scared kid who is too young to goes through all this. 
 I should point out few things about this book. Firstly there are multiple POVs in this book. But don't give up on this book in case you don't like them, cause here it's done perfectly. You see the world through August's eyes and also you see how the world sees him through other characters. Another thing is prepare your heart cause some of the thing here will break it. Even thinking about this book makes me wanna cry. Don't run away if you don't want to experience that, cause everyone should read this book. A lot of people tend to judge others by their look, appearance or what not. But have you ever though how much that hurts. Cause you can't be strong enough to survive that without a scratch especially if you're just a kid. 
 But you wanna know what's the most interesting thing about this book - while reading it and after that I still imagine August as a little lovely kid. With beautiful eyes and adorable smile. Even though the books starts with I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. I have met the August's personality and what a brave, shiny and beautiful character is he. You have no idea. 
 Of course there is the five stars for this book but quite honestly my views of the world and my thoughts have changed and there is not enough stars to give for that.

 The main character is wonderful. I love how he's just like everybody else. And what makes this read more interesting is how the author skilfully evolves us in the ten-year-old world and makes us feel like we belong. I remember what I was like when I was August's age. And many writers get it wrong by making the ten-year-olds be immature, whiny and stupid. 
 But not this book. I love how this book displays the accurate description of how fifth grade is where everybody starts maturing, having crushes but also care about popularity. I remember what it was like in fifth grade, and also how August makes it so simply written. 
 My complaint is mainly Justin's point of view, which was painful to read. No speech marks in dialogue, no capital letters. Why, oh why did the author think it'd be a good idea? It almost made me put the book down! 
 Overall, I still loved this book. And Via is down as one of the greatest female characters (in my head).

August is an ordinary kid in almost every aspect, besides the fact that he was born with a facial deformity - which obviously makes him anything but ""ordinary"". He knows he doesn't have the same chance to be standing on a stage, with thousands of people in the crowd, and receive those desired applause - because when people look at him they flinch, avoid him, and even hurl cruel insults at him. Unlike the other kids, who could grow up to be presidents or movie stars, or simply become the valedictorians at their graduation, August must limit his dreams and expectations of life. 
 August wishes for the day he could walk down the street and assimilate among everyone, to have an entirely ordinary face, one that people won't even remember - which puts our whims to become more beautiful and desirable into perspective. After all, when have any of us wished for a face that no one would notice? 
 The story is very well written, filled with humor and wit, which only enhance its original plot. It is so easy to be swept away with the pages and so it happened that from the moment I have started reading this book I just couldn't stop and finished it within a day. Not once have I wiped a tear, at times of sadness and at times of joy, over those small and simple moments of happiness in life - the happiness of a ten-year-old, no matter how they look like.

I am not a huge reader of young adult lit, but this is the Vermont Reads book this year, so I picked it up and got through it in a day. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that this is the story of a 5h grader with severe facial abnormalities, who goes to school for the first time, having been homeschooled previously. 
 It's also the story of his sister, Via, and a few of their friends and classmates. Each of them changes, and each of them realizes the wonder of normal everyday living, as they wend their way through the school year. Throughout the book, characters misread each others' intentions and reactions. They think, as kids and many adults do, that the world revolves around them, only to find that each person is fighting their own battles, and may have motivations that are completely other than what they appear to be. One of the central actions in the book revolves around a performance of Thornton Wilder's masterpiece, ""Our Town,"" in which the characters reflect on how easy it is to miss the wonder of everyday life. It is really the point of this whole book. Not just about some kid with a messed-up face and being kind to people who are different from you. It's about seeing beneath the surface. The quotes from The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe about ""the magic beneath the magic"" are also there to reinforce this concept. If you miss this theme, you don't understand the book. 
 It is also somewhat ironic, that the only happy, ""normal"" family in the book is the family with the kid with the messed-up face. This is a children's book, basically. But it is pretty damned wise for the rest of us.

 This book also establishes the fact that you don't have to have a sad end to a story to make your readers choke. Even a heart-warming, happy and bright ending can do wonders. Because it made me choke and because it has the power make your eyes wet too.

 I was born this way..."" 
 In Wonder, 11-year old August is your average kid. He has a Star Wars obsession, wants to be a scientist when he grows up, and loves playing with his dog, Daisy. He has eyes, ears, and a nose- just not in any of the right places. 
 August was born with a rare birth defect that resulted in a face deformation, a hip bone replacing the jaw he never had and his ears squished to the sides of his head. His eyes are lower than they are supposed to be and the shape of his mouth makes it hard for him to eat. Other than that, he's a totally normal kid- he just wishes everyone else would see him that way. 
 He's learned to deal with the stares and the whispers, but when his parents decide to enroll him in real school for the first time, he faces a new challenge. Seeing the school, he's excited to go, but immediately encounters but a smaller model of the world he already knows exist- those who have trouble accepting him, those that refuse to accept him, and those who wholeheartedly welcome him with empathy and make his life worth living. 
 ""Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world."" 
 At first, this book seems like the kind of tearjerker meant to make the reader feel emotion through guilt- ""Why did I used to bully that kid in eighth grade...?. A kinder way to say this is that it's meant to show us the world from the eyes a kid shunned by society and the political correctness that has those unaccepting skirt around it in cruel ways. Basically, it shows us another perspective. 
 But the book isn't just about August's story- the story is shared by multiple characters, his sister, her boyfriend, and August's friends. That's when it hits you- this isn't just a story about an unexplored perspective- it's a book that explores the pure nature of perspective. We see how dfferent types of people learn to look past what's on the outside and how they do it. Wherein they learn that sometimes what seems otherworldly is really just normal- and that's what's spectacular. 
 The book is well written although occasionally it seems like the author tries too hard to make August seem like a ""normal"" kid and so his use of slang seems forced. But the book's sense of realism is more pronounced in Palacio's unabashed allegorical use of pop-culture references. 
 The beginning is more promising than the latter half and the ending feels a tad maudlin, but the novel more than makes up for it in is vibrant humanism and assured characterizations- and what more can you ask for from a surefire Newberry book?","Sat Jun 30 18:00:46 -0700 2012","Wed Jul 25 10:21:09 -0700 2012","Wed Jul 25 10:21:09 -0700 2012","",2,0,""

 Writing style (very friendly, very emotional, easy to read, short chapters, and everyone kinda had their own style.) 
 Characters (they were deep and different from one another. I feel like Jack Will was like Ron and Charlotte [not Summer] was like Hermione and Julian was Draco!) 
 Different POVs (very interesting! Sometimes the same period of time was retold by someone else, sometimes it went on a little bit. It was cool.) 
 [[Dislikes]] 
 Storyline (Nothing happened! Omg I was waiting for something to happen all throughout the book but, ugh! And the ending was terrible! Augie was pitiful, true. But it's not like every pitiful person deserves to be praised for nothing other than being pitiful! I think it would be cool if Augie actually did something nice to everyone no matter how much they hated him, and eventually everyone started to love him. That would be a better story.)

I love the fact that it was written from different POVs of the characters in the book, also applauding for that because the writing style changed for each of them and it actually felt I am in their head experiencing and feeling what they are feeling which is remarkable. Different views gave me a greater perspective of the story and not just made me empathize majorly with one character but all of them, I understood, I felt them and the whole experience was just fantastic. 
 The characters are just lovely and dealt in depth, I was able to actually relate myself to a lot of situations and feel all the feels, I could actually put myself in there and see myself making those decisions.

 I had heard amazing things about 'Wonder' before I started reading it, and they truly didn't exaggerate. 
 I was very wary going into the book, after all, you never know with a subject that sometimes requires delicate handling whether the author will handle it or drop it on the floor... hard... 
 Fortunately R J Palacio tackles it beautifully. The book offers several different viewpoints so that we get to see not only Auggie's view of himself and the world, but how other people view him to. It also offers us an insight so we see situations from various different angles so what from one person seemed a terribly mean thing to do, would suddenly be seen from a whole new angle. 
 The different view varied from seeing how Auggie's sister copes with constantly being pushed to the side in favour of her brother, to how his new friends at school felt about him, to his sister's boyfriend. It was fascinating and offered a whole new perspective which kept the novel fresh throughout. 
 Of course the largest sections were from Auggie's point of view and he was a fascinating narrator. He truly was extraordinary, with his view of the world, of himself, his strength, his kindness and his determination, particularly in the face of some truly horrible taunts, fights and unkindness from those around him. 
 It was a thought provoking story handled very delicately and I found myself totally enthralled with Auggie's story. How it feels to be on the inside of a perfectly normal boy who just drew the short straw of the gene pool. He's not pampered or spoilt, nor is he frustrating, he is an incredibly fresh narrator and I loved sharing his story with him. 
 It was heart breaking at points to see the cruelty of those around him - not just kids, but adults. There are a series of emails part way through the book that quite literally made my blood boil, and some of the awful things the kids said made me want to reach in and wrap Auggie up in a hug. 
 My only complaints were that there wasn't a vast amount of difference between the voices. They all read very much the same, and if I hadn't been told at the start of each section who was speaking it wouldn't have been particularly obvious. 
 It was also, I have to admit a decidedly cheesy ending, but actually, I like happy endings to it didn't really both me - I know that some people might find it a little too sweet after the trials of the book though. 
 It does come across as one very decided, white middles class view point of the world, which may be frustrating to some, but because that is the only view point Auggie really has, I didn't find it too grating. 
 This truly is a wonderful book - thought provoking, funny, incredibly hard to read at some points, and joyful at others. I would recommend reading it with a box of tissues though...","Sat Feb 18 09:58:31 -0800 2012","Wed Mar 21 12:57:33 -0700 2012","Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 -0800 2012",1,0,"False"

 When given the choice between being right or being kind, 
 choose kind. 
 August Pullman e un ragazzo come tutti gli altri: e ossessionato da Star Wars, gioca ai videogiochi, legge, ha una famiglia che lo ama e un migliore amico con cui passa gran parte del suo tempo. Se non fosse che August e nato con una deformazione facciale che anche dopo parecchi interventi e migliorata di poco, che all'inizio non gli permetteva di mangiare o parlare e che pian piano gli sta portando via l'udito. E se non fosse che August, proprio per questo motivo, non e mai andato a scuola. Ora i suoi genitori hanno deciso di iscriverlo alla scuola media, dove ci saranno un sacco di altri ragazzi, e dove, August ne e sicuro, gli altri studenti gli renderanno la vita un inferno. 
 Sometimes you don't have to mean to hurt someone 
 to hurt someone. 
 All'inizio devo dire che il libro non mi aveva presa molto, forse anche a causa del blocco del lettore. Comunque, sono stata felice di averlo letto. 
 August e un ragazzino intelligente e sveglio, che non si prende molto sul serio e sa come divertirsi. Certo, ha un problema non di poco conto, visto che senza gli interventi non avrebbe neanche potuto mangiare, ma alla fin fine ha tutti gli interessi di un ragazzino della sua eta. La sua crescita nel corso del libro e immensa, mentalmente ed emotivamente. La famiglia, soprattutto la madre, e molto protettiva nei suoi confronti, anche troppo, tanto che August a volte sembra un bambino piu piccolo. Attraverso le nuove esperienze e i nuovi ambienti riesce a ""staccarsi"" da questo nido un po' soffocante e comincia a vivere una vita ""normale"": ha delle disavventure, ma trova anche degli amici. 
 Summer, Charlotte, e Jack (sopratutto quest'ultimo) crescono con August, cambiano il loro modo di atteggiarsi e scoprono cos'e davvero importante. Summer mi e piaciuta fin da subito. E lei che davvero e diventata fin quasi immediatamente amica di August e che ha capito che non e affatto diverso dagli altri ragazzini. Jack ci ha messo un po' di piu, forse, ma alla fine ha preso la strada giusta! 
 Quello che davvero non ho sopportato e stato l'atteggiamento dei ragazzi in generale, che evitavano August come se avesse la Peste e gli sparlavano dietro. Due sberloni per uno glieli avrei dati, se fossi stata uno dei genitori. E mi sarei chiesta dove ho fallito, per insegnare ai miei figli ad essere cosi cretini (per non dire altro). 
 Julian in particolare ha portato il bullismo ad un livello piu alto, rendendomelo antipatico e facendomi sperare per tutto il corso della storia che si beccasse una bella lezione. Anche i suoi genitori non sono meglio, quindi non c'e dubbio da chi abbia preso. 
 Comunque, in Wonder non seguiamo solo August mentre ha delle nuove esperienze. Ed oltre a Jack, vediamo una bella crescita anche in Via, la sorella maggiore di August. Non vuole ammetterlo, ma le da fastidio che tutto giri intorno ad August, che lui venga prima di tutto. Lo capisce. Lui e quello tra loro due che ha piu bisogno... Ma non significa che debba piacerle. Da una parte la comprendo, ma penso che debba anche capire le priorita di un genitore che vede un figlio che ha molto piu bisogno dell'altro, pur non essendo totalmente d'accordo con la condotta della madre. 
 Quindi, in generale, il libro mi e piaciuto molto e spero che possa piacere anche a voi!","Mon Aug 28 10:54:18 -0700 2017","Sat Sep 16 10:12:29 -0700 2017","Sat Sep 16 10:12:29 -0700 2017","Mon Aug 28 10:54:18 -0700 2017",1,0,""

 Part Mask, part Lucas- Wonder is the story of isolated teen, August Pullman. Up til now, Auggie has been home-schooled by his mom due to a birth defect he was born with limiting his involvement with the outside world. But all of that is about to change as the Pullman family broaches of the subject of enrolling Auggie into school with other kids his own age. In many ways, the cons outweighs the pros, but everyone agrees Auggie should try it before giving up anyway. 
 As to be expected, Auggie is the subject of ridicule, bullying and fear- all born out of the ignorance of the outside world. But as many of us can attest too, kids can be cruel- ESPECIALLY middle school kids. Wonder manages to paint Auggie's real world experiences as authentically as possible without making us feel too sorry for Auggie. Walking this balance is important, I believe. 
 In an interesting turn of events, many of the chapters of Wonder are told from varying points of view. I'm still on the fence about how I feel about how this played out in the context of the story itself, but I did appreciate the concept of seeing the same situation from varying voices. And in a way, that's really what the story of Wonder is all about- putting yourself in someone else's shoes, if only for a moment or two.","Sun Jan 05 18:43:27 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 19 19:17:58 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 19 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sun Jan 05 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0,""

The subject of a young boy with facial deformities entering middle school for the first time was intriguing and I felt sure that this would be one of those reads that tugs on your heartstrings and makes you think about life in a slightly different way. Unfortunately, I found this book to be overly sweet and unrealistically happy. I get the feeling that people are blinded to the issues this book has by the pity they feel for the main character. I know this will sound cold and snobbish, but I truly feel that this book is completely overrated. 
 As others have mentioned in their reviews, Wonder is told from multiple points of view. We hear from Auggie, the main character, and we also hear from his sister Via, her boyfriend, one of her friends and some of Auggie's friends. For me, the vast majority of these viewpoints are unnecessary, sound the same, and add nothing to the story. I would have preferred the narration to be split between Auggie and his sister: Auggie, because it's kind of necessary to see his perspective and Via because she is the only interesting character. 
 Indeed, Via was the high point of the story for me. She speaks of having live constantly in Auggie's shadow and struggles with feelings of guilt for feeling that way. I could completely see her viewpoint and I felt for her. 
 I did not relate to Auggie at all. I actually found him to be quite annoying, a total brat, and not realistic in his thoughts or actions. I am a teacher. I teach kids the same age as Auggie. I thought he was portrayed as too simple-minded. He read more like a 3rd or 4th grader to me. Also, kids do not say ""dude"" to each other like the kids in this book do. I promise. I just couldn't bring myself to care for him. 
 My biggest issue with the novel was the ending. As I said before, I found it to be unrealistically happy, but it was more than that. At the end of the book, Auggie gets an award at his middle school graduation ceremony for basically doing nothing except ""being strong."" In the real world, people don't get awards for being born with birth defects. I found this to be just ridiculous. If anyone deserved an award, it was Auggie's friend at school who sacrificed his own popularity to do the right thing and he kind to someone in need. I just hated this ending. Seriously. An award. 
 The message of this book is undoubtedly important and in spite of my issues with it, I would still recommend it to my students. I, however, just didn't find it to be as great as all the hype. Maybe it's my blackened heart, but I thought this saccharine mess of a story was badly in need of a reality check.","Sat Oct 20 06:20:53 -0700 2012","Sat Nov 09 13:03:53 -0800 2013","Sun Sep 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"True"

The parts of the novel that focused on Auggie and his struggle for acceptance and inclusion were well done, and I'm hugely in favor of the way that Auggie was shown to be an ordinary ten-year-old despite his face. 
 But the novel suffered from Palacio's need to give everyone a voice. I have a love/hate relationship with multiple perspective voices in a novel; it has to be done really well to get me on board, and here it just wasn't. There were too many, and they didn't evenly share the weight of the narrative. Also, the voices weren't distinct enough to be easily differentiated. 
 I also found the sister's subplot to be unnecessary, overly dramatic, and inaccurate (high school theatre programs don't work as presented here, and the minute Via was cast as the Understudy, I knew she would be performing the role in the end. That's a massively overused cliche and it always bothers me. I know that most of my irritation of this point comes from being in the business of high school theatre, so it's a minor point, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine.) 
 I wish this novel had stuck to Auggie's story, and kept the perspectives down to Auggie's and maybe his sister. The concept and message are solid. The execution needed work.","Wed Aug 08 16:13:38 -0700 2012","Sat Sep 14 07:43:43 -0700 2013","Wed May 09 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,"True"

August is a 5th grade boy going to school for the first time after being home schooled for his education due to the fact that has a severe craniofacial abnormality. He would now face the often unkind world of middle school and the students that he was now about to join were completely unprepared for his presence in their lives.

 This book was awesome. I think every kid should read it, it has good values to teach. Some parts are funny, just like how kids like it. You get to see the POV's of 6 different characters which I thought was very cool. The way August goes through his first year in school was well described. Friendships, misunderstandings, bullying, he goes through it all just like any other 10 year old kid, except maybe he goes through worse because of the condition he was born with - mandibulofacial dysostosis. A touching story that will make you laugh and cry, if you are a 8-12 year old and haven't read it yet, it's time you do.

Auggie is not like the other new kids at school; sure he is smart, he wears the same kinds of clothes, and he likes the same kinds of things as the other kids, but Auggie looks different. Auggie has had over 20 operations on his face to make it more ""normal"" but it is never going to look like the other kids. He has been called freak, freddy kruger, told his face has melted and lots of other mean things. Will he ever make friends at school? will he ever have a normal life? 
 Auggie pulls at your heartstrings. His story is touching, heart-warming, sad, joyful, makes you want to cry; I could go on and on. He is such a little trooper through everything he goes through in this book. You can imagine the horror he has to face every day just trying to fit into a world that doesn't accept him. I think this is a good story about bullying and seeing the good in others and accepting people for who they are not what they look like. The book has a great message. 
 The book is told not just through Auggie's voice but through the voices of those around him. We hear from his sister, his friends, her friends, etc. Some of these work better than others and some seem pointless, but they all show what life is like around Auggie. It is not easy for anyone. 
 I guess my one nitpick of this story is that it is almost to simplified. This is almost a fairytale version of what someone in Auggie's situation would go through. We do see the hardship and the bullying, but then things turn around and he has his happily ever after kind of moment. Doesn't make it a bad book (because it isn't); I just think it simplified things way down. Still the book is a delight to read and I would definitely recommend it.

 3.5/5 
 I really want to give this a perfect 5 stars, really. Most of August's stories and adventures were really touching and brilliant, especially when those stories were told from different points of view. 
 I guess I'd start by saying that I enjoyed August's transformation, his thoughts, and his obstacles--it was as if I experienced it myself. The fact that the writing is simple, like fifth-grader simple, makes the book beautifully written. Also, the nostalgia! 
 I really loved August. Let's just start from the fact that he's a really tough kid despite he's really sentimental and he cried a lot of times (I think this is really accurate for a fifth grade). I liked how he narrates his own story from the first person POV. 
 I was mad when I found out that that little bastard Jack Will betrayed him. Seriously. And I hated Julian and his shitty attitude. That's how much I loved him for being an ass. I also expected more of Julian's side of the story, but what the heck, he's an asshole. Perhaps he'll change someday. 
 It's a book about family and society, too. The way August's family treats and raises their two children, particularly August? I think it's splendid. They're like actual real parents. I'm going, to be honest here: August's family is the most loving and caring family of all the family history I've ever encountered, especially his mother. 
 I just didn't quite enjoyed the other chapters as much as I enjoyed August's. Perhaps the story just went on a different way (but they connect anyway). I was so focused on expecting more of August's story, but I think it wouldn't be great if the chapters weren't split into different POVs, though. 
 I am absolutely looking forward to reading the next book. I hope the next book will be set in the future, especially when he's a teenager or even an adult","Fri Sep 16 09:11:32 -0700 2016","Sun Sep 18 07:13:03 -0700 2016","Sun Sep 18 07:13:03 -0700 2016","Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

 Overview: 
 ""When given the choice between being right and being kind, choose kind."" 
 I don't read a lot of middle-grade, but this broached an assortment of complicated topics with more sensitivity than most 'adult' books and really surprised me. 
 The main character, August was born with a facial abnormality that not only resulted in dozens of surgeries, but prevented him from attending school until 5th grade. This story revolves around his first year at his new school. 
 Pros: 
 The narrators range in from 10 year-olds to highschool-students and the voices reflect this. The kids sounded like kids. The teenagers sounded like teenagers. Everyone had a distinct voice that wasn't limited by age. 
 The message here is important. I strongly believe this book would be a great gift for a child around August's age, because it opens all sorts of conversations about empathy. It encourages them to think about the ramifications of their actions and the way they view each other, without being overwhelming or needlessly dark. 
 Via's story was my favorite and I wasn't expecting the switch to her POV, but I'm so glad it was there. It's easy to get wrapped up in August's story and how it affects him daily--but R. J. Palacio doesn't let you forget it's the same for his family. This was a more complicated approach than I expected from this book, and I think it was handled with care. 
 I appreciated that August's classmates were of all different races, socioeconomic backgrounds and religions. 
 August was a very precious and loving kid, and it was incredibly easy to root for him. 
 Cons: 
 Probably because I don't read a lot of middle-grade, I didn't fully connect with this the way someone younger (or more willing to enter that mind-set) might have. This story is very wholesome and upbeat, and looking through cynical-adult glasses, I couldn't help but feel it lost realism because of it. 
 Via's boyfriend has his own POV... told without punctuation or capitalization? It was incredibly frustrating to read and actually made his chapters harder to understand. I couldn't understand why Palacio decided to do this, until I found this quote from her website: 
 ""I remember thinking back then, especially when I would get into the really low notes, that notes on a musical staff looked a little like lowercase letters of the alphabet...Maybe it's because I've been a graphic designer for so many years, but I'm trained to see typefaces and fonts not just as communication devices, but as visual cues for other things. So when it came to writing from Justin's point of view, because he's a musician, someone who thinks in musical terms, it just seemed natural for me to use lowercase letters to represent his thoughts in a very visual way. He's the kind of person who doesn't talk a lot, because he's naturally shy, but has a lot going on inside. The running monologue inside his head has no time for capital letters or punctuation: it's like his thoughts are streaming inside his mind. 
 ...so I understand. But personally, I still didn't like it. I think there were better ways of communicating Justin's character without font-tricks. 
 I'm totally nit-picking here, but why did everyone talk about 5th grade being the first year of middle school? Because where I'm from, middle school is grades six through eight and 5th is still elementary. 
 In Conclusion: 
 A sweet Middle-Grade story that showcases the importance of empathy through a diverse cast of characters and one adorable little boy.","Thu Oct 27 20:45:36 -0700 2016","Thu Sep 14 10:21:34 -0700 2017","Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 -0700 2017",62,16,"False"

He was home-schooled and sheltered up until his early adolescence, when his parents persuade him to begin attending school. August is, rightfully, terrified: what will the kids say? Think? Do? How will he be treated? Despite his fears, he takes the leap and starts school. Angsty, terrifying, adolescence. August is the protagonist, and often the narrator, but there are several other characters who take the storytelling helm. 
 August has an older sister, Via, who is protective of her little brother, but also worried that his deformity will affect her reputation. She struggles with the unconditional love she feels for her brother and her own difficult transition into teenage-hood and a new school. 
 Miranda was Via's best friend. That is, until they hit puberty. While Via and Miranda struggle, Miranda continues to love and support August. Miranda uses August's story in a way entirely contrary to Via's, but you should read it for yourself. 
 And then, there are August's new friends. The ones he makes in school: Summer, Jack Will, and others. Each shares what it's like to be the friend of a boy with a face like August's. And the ensuing social fallout so closely linked with friendship to a pariah. 
 My favorite piece of the book: Mr. Brown's precepts. Mr. Brown is August's English teacher and he insists that the students record his monthly precepts and then develop their owns. The chapter Choose Kind explains the process, and I feel I should adopt it for my own. Check out the appendix for a list of the year's precepts and those mailed in by students in August's class. 
 I read this book at the recommendation of my mother, who raved endlessly about it. She works in an elementary school and many of the teachers were being encouraged to read Wonder. I must admit, I'm less enthusiastic about this YA novel than she is. It was good, but I don't think it was great. I believe it is always valuable to explore differences, disabilities, and how we treat one another; Palacio does a fine job, just not an exceptional one.

 This work is full of emotions and feelings that makes you laugh at parts, cry at others, and cry laughably (if it makes sense!) in between. Simply it's a wonderful book. 
 Wonder leaves you rethink about some aspects of life. At the end of every part I give myself a space to question things concerning ever single person. How they look at the story from their own perspective and acts according to it. 
 However, the story type is basically inspired by others of the same kind -which is one of my favorites- but it still has its own spirit. 
 On top of that, It plainly shows that your principles determine who you are initially to yourself and accordingly to others.

 This was an easy read in terms of the writing style. In terms of content, it was a little hard because of the torment this kid had to endure from not only students his age, but from adults. Reading about bullying is always hard, but in Auggie's case, the fact that he has a deformation that he cant ""fix"" made it a little sadder. This is a great coming of age story of a little kid in his first year of school after being home schooled his entire life.

It addresses the inside life of Augustus, a severely disfigured young boy. Specifically, it follows him through the fifth grade, his first year in a public school. It deeply explores his emotions, as well as those people close to him. 
 WONDER is well-written and extremely touching. I challenge anyone not to get choked up at the end of this story (and possibly several places throughout). Palacio chose to give Augustus and several other key characters their own (First Person) chapter, thus getting inside each person's head one by one. This was probably the right decision, as it would have been tough to pull off an Omniscient point of view for all characters at the same time. My problem with this choice, however, was that it slowed down the narrative and made the story a bit tedious. So that Palacio could illustrate specific events through multiple characters' eyes, she had to repeat these key scenes multiple times. I also felt the narrative was a bit preachy at times; a little more subtlety might have made it a stronger book. 
 Everybody has at one time or another encountered people with visible disabilities--whether it be a bald head due to chemotherapy, someone in a wheelchair, or someone, such as Augustus with a birth defect--and this book truly, deeply addresses that awkward moment. Because of this book, I will be better able to see these people as PEOPLE, not as their disability. 
 I am very happy to have read WONDER. I recommend it.

Middle school can be brutal for anyone but for Auggie it could be terrifying. The story is told from different perspectives as you ride on the adventure of his fifth grade year. 
 I rotated between wanted to smack some of the kids and wanting to hug others. Children can be brutal. Their parents can be brutal. In the end though, this book is positive, life-affirming and full of love.

 It's being a while since I hadn't write a review so today I feel like writing a little so here comes my review... 
 The other day I went to a library (only to see what's new) I didn't consider to buy a book but especially one got my attention so I decided to buy it ""Wonder "" by R.J Palacio was the one , I didn't expect I will loved this book so much! :D ""Wonder"" is one of those books that everyone should read, it's absolutely AMAZING!; Palacio wrote an incredible story, in every page she show us how important kindness is, no matter your age. I loved all the characters especially Auggie I learned so much about him and his family, that no matter what, you ALWAYS have to have a big smile on your face or that is so much better if you laugh about your problems, that we should enjoy everything and have the courage to keep going no matter what. 
 This book left me with so much; I couldn't put it down until finish it. Auggie is one of those characters you'll love 'till the end of the book and will always remember.

 This book is special and so are all of its characters. And you see the events from not only Augie's point of view, but also from his friends' and sister's. Real life is not black and white. There aren't purely good and purely bad people. Seeing the events in all of their colors and how they affect the main characters was fantastic.

 Oh Wonder. I was sure I wouldn't like you, was sure your narration was going to rile against me rather than go along side by side, and I thought ""oh dear, this is not for me"" as I read the first few pages, possibly even a little glad because my pile of books to read was so huge already. But then I looked up and I was 20 pages through, and I hadn't realised. I had got so caught up in Auggie's voice and story, and even if it sometimes felt a teensy bit juvenile for me it didn't matter because it was him. And then I was seventy pages. Then 120. And I kept reading in massive increments, finishing the book in a single day, I loved it so much, got so caught in it.

He's the kind of kid I think I would want to be friends with. I think it's a good book that everyone should read...and I think you should read the other wonder books.

If you do know me personally, you would know that this story of August Pullman is very close to my heart. Reading this felt like having a conversation with someone like myself although by no means I would say that our case is similar. August Pullman is much stronger and optimistic than myself, he easily puts me to shame although he is just a fictional character. 
 Saying that, I consider he is real which is somewhat true because I am aware of just how many Augusts in this world, battling society's cruel treatment and perception everyday and I would like to borrow that strength. 
 It's interesting how I started reading with a mindset that this book will be a heart-breaking, depressive tear-jerker. Instead, I smiled, I laughed, I shed happy tears, I shed sad tears (unexpectedly because the dog dies :'( 
 The only drawback was when the book was narrated from Justin POV. I just couldn't stand the lack of proper punctuation.

 Our main character--a pathetic mess of one, at that--August, practically wallows self-pity throughout the length of the book. He constantly mourns the product of his condition. I might have liked him more had he not been so babied and childish as well. 
 I question the accurate level of maturity in the characters of the book. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but in my experience, 11 year olds are not as immature and do not have the simplicity of a 7-year old. I quote you with this paragraph: 
 ""Um, no,"" I answered. ""Oh, well, actually, yes. Is your name Jack or Jack Will?"" 
 ""Jack is my first name. Will is my last name"" 
 ""Oh, because Mr. Tushman introduced you as Jack Will, so I thought..."" 
 ""Ha! You thought his name was Jack Will!"" laughed Julian."" 
 You couldn't get any more childish than that. 
 I also had many problems with August's narrative. To describe it in a phrase: John Green wannabe; the type of writing that reads kind of aloof and distant, but instead of thoughtful prose that perfectly executes this kind of writing, the sentences are extremely ridiculous, make no sense, and are absolutely cringy. Refer to the paragraph below: 
 I have other friends, too, but not as good as Christopher and Zack and Alex were. For instance, Zack and Alex always invited me to their birthday parties when we were little, but Joel and a Eamonn and Gabe never did. Emma invited me once, but I haven't seem her in a long time. And of course, I always go to Christopher's birthday. Maybe I'm making too big a deal about birthday parties. 
 The comment about the birthday parties at the end is completely unnecessary and it feels weird reading it. 
 I did enjoy the other perspectives greater than the barren swamp I struggled through that was August's perspective brick by brick, but as a casual reader and not a student required to read this book, it was not enough to garner enough interest to finish the rest of the book. Most of the characters are one-dimensional, their dialogue highly unrealistic, and overall a general mess. Highly would not recommend, not even if you're looking for a book with simple imagery and themes to get out of a reading slump.","Sat Nov 26 21:52:25 -0800 2016","Thu Dec 01 09:00:00 -0800 2016","Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 -0800 2016",0,0,""

 The language is simple, at a level that a ten-year-old child can easily read. It suits the book not only because that's how old Auggie' is but also because it lays everything bare to the reader. It isn't hiding anything. All the characters' emotions and actions are laid out for us, from superficial behavior to their innermost thoughts, from their doubts and guilt to their happiness and bliss. After all, it's not easy being around someone with such an obvious disfiguration even if it's someone as sweet as Auggie. 
 Auggie is a funny character. As in he's witty and says the funniest things ever in a matter-of-fact tone. It makes me wish I were his friend, so I can banter around with him. He lacks courage and self-esteem at the beginning of the novel because he knows how bad his facial deformities are. It's to the point that he grows out his bangs because if he can't see people's reactions, then he doesn't feel so bad. At least, that's what he tells himself. In truth, he can guess at what people think about him; he sees the whispers, gestures, and furtive looks. Then he makes friends--real friends that stick up for him--and he's able to open up and show his peers just what a wonderful kid he is. And it's so wonderful to see people grow to accept him. 
 I hadn't expected the multiple perspectives, and it was a wonderful surprise. I was glad to see that Auggie's perspective kep reappearing, but other people whose lives he touches jump in from time to time. And it's a great way to introduce things that we wouldn't have known if only Auggie's perspective was given. There is Summer, who joins him at lunch out of pity and grows to like him as a person. Jack, who first talks to him at the Mr. Tushman's request but also grows to cherish his friendship. Auggie's older sister Via, whose fierce protection over her little brother is something I can relate to. Her boyfriend Justin. Her friend, ex-friend, friend Miranda who loves Auggie as if he were her own brother. Auggie is surrounded by many loving people, and though his deformities make him look like a ""freak,"" to quote idiots in the book, he has one of the kindest hearts out there. He makes me feel like I can be a better person. 
 This book really hits home because it makes you wonder what you would do if you went to school with a kid like Auggie. Would you go against the crowd to sit down with him and have a nice chat? Would you jeopardize your 'friendships' with other people to stand up for him or her? It's a lot easier for us when we're older to stay true to ourselves, though it's still not effortless. I don't want to admit this, but the ten-year-old me probably would have stuck with the neutral camp. I wouldn't want to be mean to him, but I wouldn't stand up for him either. Heck, the teenage me may not have had the courage to try to talk to him like a normal person. And that's why it's so horrible. 
 When I think about it, a bully is someone you can stand up to. Someone who ignores your existence is harder to push away because there's nothing there in the first place. I wouldn't want people to treat my existence like the Plague. What we need to remember is that sometimes it's not what we do but what we don't do that really hurts. Auggie wants to be accepted for himself, but there are kids who won't spend more time than necessary with him even if they're neutral and it really hurts him. At the same time, courage is necessary because Auggie needs to make the first step to help people acknowledge that he's a person--and a cool one at that. It takes going to middle school, speaking up to people, and standing up for his friends like they stand up for him. 
 This easily takes the spot of the middle grade book of the year for me. I recommend this for everyone.

After multiple operations, his parents decide that he should start school - in grade 5. How will he get through the day with people staring at him? Mocking him? Generally being mean to him? With friends who are there for him. 
 A truly inspirational story where people can succeed with huge obstacles in front of them.

 Auggie Pullman will wrap you in your world and will give you a real insight into the world of a kid with a deformed face. He'll have you laugh and cry with him. 
 A coming-of-the-Age book for sure. 
 Apart from Auggie's story it was Olivia's patience and innocence and unselfish need to be noticed, that moved me the most. 
 Most of all, it let's you know that it isn't just the bullied kid that needs to be sympathized with but also the Bully, himself :')","Fri Jul 29 08:08:41 -0700 2016","Wed Aug 03 06:41:58 -0700 2016","Fri Jul 29 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Fri Jul 29 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

I had seen the book around and was familiar with the cover but not the content. It was my son's summer reading assignment so I read it too and was blown away on every level. 
 The book is told from various character's points of view. August (Auggie) Pullman has been home-schooled his entire life. He was born with a facial deformity and has undergone numerous surgeries to help correct it but he still looks different and his parents felt it was best to be schooled at home. Now that he is about to enter the fifth grade they feel it would be best for him to enroll in a private school where they can better take over his education. You know that there will be problems to overcome and Auggie's story is told in a way that touches your heart. 
 This book approaches special needs, bullying, friendship, love of family and acceptance perfectly. I am the parent of a special needs child and even though my daughter doesn't have a facial deformity, we as a family have experienced so many similar things that are touched on in this book. The gratefulness that I feel for any other child that has patience for my child and befriends her and is kind to her means the world to me. When I finished reading this book I cried and I also wanted to stand up and cheer for Auggie. R.J. Palacio has done a phenomenal job of conveying a story that is so inspirational. Everyone should read this book and hopefully it will teach every reader to think twice before dismissing anyone who looks or acts differently from the norm.","Thu Aug 10 19:30:48 -0700 2017","Sat Sep 30 11:50:28 -0700 2017","Wed Aug 16 03:51:44 -0700 2017","Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Then the heartstrings tugged, the emotions pulled, and I bumped this up to 5 stars. So far my first 5- star read of 2017! I didn't realize going into this fully what it was about, it fit a challenge, and is becoming a movie this year so I wanted to read it (sad/happy news- the movie release date got pushed from April to November in hopes of higher viewership). I was met with relatibility I wasn't expecting, a unique perspective, and a heartwarming moral of the story. 
 This follows Auggie, a boy starting the 5th grade in public school for the first time because he has a facial deformity. It's about bullying, it's about courage, it's about coming of age. The book has shifting perspectives between Auggie and his sister and classmates. This gave a different perspective from teenage minds and how actions can be perceived differently- a great look into how other's think. Especially for a young adult reader. But it isn't a depressing story- yes, Auggie is bullied. But it's more the positivity about how to handle, recover, and ""be brave"". I'm realizing how corny this sounds, but hey. If it works- it works. 
 The only things that bugged me about this- which clearly I overlooked where Justin's chapter- HOLY CRAP. It was written as he would- so there was incorrect punctuation, spelling, captivation, generally written as a teenager- it was SO hard to read. Also what kind of school has a graduation every year for every class? Seems a bit much... 
 What I didn't realize going into this was that Auggie has a cleft palate. Pair this with multiple other things, that is why Auggie's face is ""different"". The main reason this got 5 stars from me? Ding ding ding! I had a cleft palate when I was born too. Luckily, I had multiple surgeries as a kid to get all that stuff fixed, and my face is and has been completely normal since I can remember- but this really hit home for me. I'm so grateful for everything that I had- and Auggie did not. Craniofacial difficulties is real, it's hard, and it's something that despite ""looking normal"" it doesn't mean it doesn't effect other things. (dental issues, scarring, speech and language issues, orthodontia, the list goes on). I totally take for granted what Auggie had to deal with in every page of this book. 
 Just take my 5 stars, my tears and emotions, and let me linger on this book for a while longer.","Thu Jan 12 16:32:17 -0800 2017","Tue Feb 21 11:45:39 -0800 2017","Tue Feb 21 14:57:22 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 -0800 2017",4,0,"False"

This touching story tells how he, his family, friends and some not so sympathetic schoolmates deal with the various reactions to how he looks.

 While I enjoyed the story and it did tug at my heart, I found it to be very hard-hitting. I know kids are mean but this seemed very full on for such young people. I think this would be a good things for kids to read as it emphasises the feelings such awful behaviour can have on the person affected, but I, as an adult, was kind of horrified that so many people got away with such nastiness (yes I'm looking at you Julian and family!). 
 The story is told from multiple perspectives which really worked, making it easy to see the multiple points of view. From Auggie to his friends, and family, it painted a picture of Auggie's journey.

What I liked the most is that it wasn't just from August's point of view. It was also from the point of view of his friends. You should read it."" 
 Mum's 2 cents: 
 Great book to read-aloud; really takes you inside the mind of a child who is ""different"", a concept which will likely appeal to all kids. Really highlights the issue of empathy, by giving kids the chance to ""see what it feels like"". And when the going gets tough with the inevitable bullying that comes when August starts school, it has the desired effect on the reader - we felt bad, really bad, for August. The first part of the novel has great pace (and chapters are extraordinarily short which gives the impression you're zipping through it), but I felt it lost its way a bit after the first half. Having said that, I don't think it was the intent for the book to have a climax at the end, as with a traditional novel, rather there were a series of ups and downs throughout, perfectly mimicking how an actual school year goes. Highly recommended.","Sat Mar 30 22:39:00 -0700 2013","Sun Mar 31 23:40:46 -0700 2013","Wed Mar 27 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",1,0,"False"

It's the story of Auggie a young boy who was born with a facial deformity and at the age of ten is about to start school for the first time. It's the story of his journey through socialisation and the horrible world of middle-school where kids say exactly what they think and will stare without a thought. It's the story of friendships; both new and old and what it takes to test, break and fix these. It's the story of family; the glue that holds them together and the strains ones family has to overcome when presented with a disability. It's the story of Via, or Olivia as she wants hence to be known as, who for the first time in her life is able to have an identity other than 'Auggie's sister' and her guilt that comes along with that. 
 In other words it's a beautiful narrative about life. About hardships. The writing itself is rather frank and brutal in its honesty but it does so with humour to dispel any discomfort. For example, Auggie's school principal is Mr. Tushman. It's told through a number of perspectives and at one point through the use of modern 'social' communications (facebook, email, etc..). It's a novel that will put you in the shoes of a number of people and make you think about your past, present and future actions. 
 Although its aimed at a middle school audience, Auggie's story is suitable for anyone who can read. Especially Adults. Its poignant and beautiful and I'm glad that I ha the chance to read it.","Tue Dec 18 04:42:32 -0800 2012","Wed Jan 30 04:31:41 -0800 2013","Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 -0800 2013",1,0,""

The story was told from about six or seven different POVs and only three were told by girls and their sections felt the shortest of the different sections. I guess the girls got half of the sections, but they felt much shorter than the boys' sections. 
 Other than that and Justin's lack of capitalization, not bad. It is definitely a thought provoking book. An interesting concept and way to look at different issues people have. Not everyone has an issue as obvious as August, which was slightly touched on when Miranda and Justin compared their family and home life to August's. It's important to remember that we all have our cross to bear. Some just hide it better than others. But we all need love and kindness, regardless of how obvious our problems. 
 I think this would be a good book for middle readers. It broaches some important topics in an engaging way for children. Good read.","Mon Feb 10 04:34:01 -0800 2014","Tue May 06 18:02:08 -0700 2014","Tue May 06 17:51:13 -0700 2014","Thu Apr 24 00:00:00 -0700 2014",3,6,"False"

It is written primarily from the point of view of a ten year old boy, August, who has severe facial deformities.

He's been homeschooled all his life and then his parents encourage him to attend fifth grade in public school. This is the story of that horrible and wonderful first year. 
 There is so much story to this book and so much that happens, that I can't go further without giving the whole thing away. I will say that this is a story of courage, triumph, acceptance and kindness that everyone, particularly children in the upper elementary grades and miffle school MUST read.But even more importantly, their parents should read it as well.

 REVIEW: 
 It is a wonderful thing to be surprised by a novel. That was my experience with Wonder, a middle grade novel I've been meaning to read for quite some time and finally got around to. The novel tells the story of August, a boy born with a misshapen face who is finally going to a real school for the first time in his fifth grade year. I was delighted, appalled, angry, sad, and hopeful in equal measures, a testament to the author's ability to write her characters so that they leap off the page and come to life. 
 August has had a rough go of things, and has lived a mostly sheltered life with the family who loves him dearly. The challenge of attending a real school, where there are children his age that might not necessarily treat him nicely, is daunting. But August makes a brave choice to attend classes, and be among these people who act like he's got the ""Plague"" (initially anyway). 
 Eventually, August is revealed to be smart, funny and kind - and perfectly normal, in spite of the way he looks. He accepts the way he is, learns to interact with others and basically, teaches all of us - his classmates and readers alike - that it's not about how you look, it's about how you act. 
 This, essentially, is what makes the novel excellent. Using not only August's point of view, but that of the people who surround him - his sister Olivia, his sister's boyfriend Justin, his friend Summer, his other friend Jack, his sister's former best friend - Wonder takes readers on a journey that will break your heart, and put it back together again. 
 There are plenty of ways to react to someone who is different, ranging from kind to not-so-kind. And different perspectives are touched upon in the novel, embodied in a variety of characters. Wonder is about how each person, no matter what they look like, should be treated with respect, kindness and consideration. But what the novel showed me, in the end, was how our actions towards others have consequences and we can choose whether or not to act in a way that is good. It's a simple life lesson, but an essential one, and Wonder tackles it beautifully. 
 Honestly, I'd recommend Wonder to just about anyone. It isn't a long read, but it's the kind of story that'll punch you a little bit in the gut and make you reevaluate how you see and treat other people. With a main character that's easy to root for, some great secondary characters and a pretty simple but awesome story, I'm sincerely glad I finally took the time to read Wonder.

Twenty-seven surgeries have improved the appearance of his facial deformities but according to Auggie (and reactions from strangers) he always stands out like a black sheep in a heard of white. In fact Halloween is the only night of the year where he blends in. ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever your'e thinking, it's probably worse"" (1). Wonder tells the story of Auggie's fifth grade year through alternating viewpoints: Auggie, his older sister Olivia (Via), friends from school (Summer and Jack), his sister's boyfriend (Justin) and his sister's ex-friend (Miranda). It's hard not to fall in love with Auggie's character- he's courageous, kind, sarcastic, funny...he's the type of kid who makes people better for knowing him. Via describes her brother as ""the Sun. Me and Mom and Dad are planets orbiting the Sun. The rest of our family and friends are asteroids and comets floating around the planets orbiting the Sun"" (85). Via is an empathetic, altruistic sister and daughter but everyone yearns to be the center of the universe, at least once in a while; and at her new high school, she has a chance to be more than just ""Auggie's sister. ""Because like Auggie pointed out, ""I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" When Via's boyfriend lands the lead role in the Our Town play and she makes understudy for another main character, Via doesn't tell her parents or Auggie which causes obvious turmoil within their family. But sometimes conflict is necessary for change to take place.

 I LOVE this story. I LOVE these characters. I have SO MUCH SYMPATHY FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE *coughs* *characters* that my heart just broke so many times! I'm so glad the chapters are super short. Everything is explained to the point, no unnecessary story time wasted and no random info. I could put the book down and feel sad, think about it, do other things because life. This book probably would've been unputdownable if I had the time and the attention-span. 
 The book is told from multiple POV's which can sometimes be annoying (in other books) but Palacio did such an amazing job! It just made the book feel so well rounded and just made me love everyone way more. I swear, these characters are now my friends and I would like to know what's happening in their lives. 
 I don't really buy the ending, but I guess that's the wonderful world of fiction for you. Or maybe things like that do happen irl to some people sometimes, I don't know. Overall I really enjoyed this. I've been in a terrible reading slump this year and somehow I felt like a MG book would be a good change. I definitely recommend this. 
 For anyone who doesn't know, and wants to know, this book is about August Pullman, a young boy with... I don't even know what kind of fancy medical words to use, but basically his face is not like something anyone has seen before. This book takes place during the time he's in the 5th grade, his first time ever in (traditional? normal?) school, and his experiences (more of a focus on his experiences with people than actual school work). 
 Personal perk: it's told in first person narrative! Like the characters are telling you their story! I love that.","Fri Jun 02 00:21:20 -0700 2017","Sun Jun 11 14:28:57 -0700 2017","Sun Jun 11 14:28:57 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 02 00:21:21 -0700 2017",1,0,""

 August is a boy who is about to enter middle school and as everyone remembers - middle school separates the men from the boys, the strong from the weak and the popular from the kids last to be picked for kickball. With all of this pressure to fit in August has a lot to worry about but his real fear is that he will be pointed at, picked on and will not have any friends because of his severe facial deformities. His parents are worried, his older sister Via is worried and August is worried. Despite the natural meanness of middle school age kids, August does make friends but his story is not without cruelty and kindness found in unusual places. We all judge a book by its cover and the person by how they look but I hope kids will read Wonder and take away its message.","Wed Mar 07 06:04:20 -0800 2012","Sun Mar 11 10:25:06 -0700 2012","Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 -0800 2012",1,0,""

 4.5 stars 
 August Pullman is just an ordinary boy, but with a not-so-ordinary face. Persuaded into attending public school for the first time, Auggie has a lot of new things, both good and bad, to learn about. 
 Wonder is a book that I didn't expect to ever read. I'd see it many times wherever books are sold and heard it was good, but it was a middle grade novel so I thought I wouldn't enjoy it much so I skipped part it. In January, my school's Book Club chose to read this book. I was glad we did, because I really enjoyed it. 
 I adore all the characters (except Julian of course). The book is written mostly through Auggie's pont of view, although it does switch it up a few times. Auggie sounded like a genuine fifth grader. I did like Via's, Summer's, Jack's, Justin's, and Miranda's chapters. There is a lot of character development, which is good. I just wish the end had went a little more in depth about what happened to each character. 
 Another thing I liked about this book was all the references to movies, songs, etc.. I'm a huge Star Wars fan so I was ecstatic with Auggie being a huge fan and having many things relate to it. 
 Wonder is definitely an amazing book that everyone should read despite their age. It's really one of those books that make you really think about your life compared to others. I can't wait to see the movie adaption coming out later this year!","Sat Feb 25 08:26:49 -0800 2017","Sun Mar 05 15:23:08 -0800 2017","Sun Mar 05 15:23:08 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 25 08:27:09 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

It was, by turn, funny, poignant, heartbreaking, nostalgic, and triumphant. There were parts that made me laugh out loud, and a great portion of it had me crying my eyes out. I read it in less than a day, staying up till 5am so I could finish it. 
 The book tells the story of August Pullman, a young boy born with severe facial deformities who starts attending middle school after being homeschooled until that point. It deals with his experiences in school, both from his perspective, as well as from the perspectives of some of his friends, classmates, and family. I really liked the multiple-voice perspective as it really enriched the story and gave it a lot more depth. At times it was so painful to read about the bullying and abuse Auggie endured that I had to put the book down and walk away for a couple hours before I could go on. Middle school can be a horrible time for many kids, and kids can be so mean. Most of us who have survived middle school were not as badly bullied as Auggie, but for many of us who were different in some way probably faced it in some form. Even 20+ years later, that can be a painful time for many of us to look back on. 
 Although written as a ""young adult"" book, this is one that everyone should read, whether you're nine years old, or ninety-nine. The lessons it teaches about friendship, love, loyalty, and kindness are ones we can all stand to learn. And, to paraphrase one of the characters, we should all make it a rule to be kinder than needed.","Sun Sep 22 09:28:24 -0700 2013","Mon Sep 23 10:54:08 -0700 2013","Mon Sep 23 10:54:08 -0700 2013","Sun Sep 22 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,0,""

I wouldn't call them errors, but just a few things that bothered me throughout, such as the repetitive use of names in dialogue, which pulled me out of the story, because no one says another person's name THAT much.

August Pullman was born with a rare genetic disorder and has cranio-facial abnormalities. He has been homeschooled, because he has been in and out of hospital for most of his life, but his parents have decided to send him to school for fifth grade. This novel is the story of his fifth grade year. 
 The book is told in the voices of Auggie, his sister Via, his friends, Jack and Summer, Via's boyfriend Justin and her friend Miranda. There is one chapter told in emails and text messages, which gives us further perspectives on an incident. This is interesting, because Auggie says at the beginning that he doesn't want to tell us what he looks like; this information comes from Via most strongly. 
 What I really liked about the novel is that Auggie has to constantly deal with the reactions of other people, again and again, and this is not glossed over. Neither is the reaction of adults: we learn that some parents have photoshopped him out of school photos, for example. However, Palacio also lets us know that all of the young characters have difficulties, whether that is Via having to always be the good girl because Auggie needs care, or dealing with the death of a parent, divorcing parents or trying to fit in in a private school when your parents aren't wealthy. The reader empathises when the characters don't behave well. 
 I'm not keen on using books to point moral messages, but I do think the message of Mr Tushman's end of year speech is important: we should try to be a little kinder. A great book to read and discuss with children in Y5 or 6, perhaps alongside materials from Changing Faces charity www.changingfaces.org.uk. Highly recommended for teachers with an interest in inclusive practice.","Thu Nov 15 13:26:19 -0800 2012","Wed Jul 24 05:43:29 -0700 2013","Sun Nov 18 06:57:13 -0800 2012","Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 -0800 2012",0,0,""

 I'm so glad I finally managed to purchase a copy of this book. I've been wanting to read it for months. 
 I really have no negative criticism to add, for it offered me one of the most wonderful and touching readings I have memory of. This is a very simple story, the story of August, the story of all Augusts, and a truly powerful one it is. 
 The writing is extremely simple, therefore it can be understood and read by anyone of any age, for its message will never be lost. I think it is also a terrific book to be recommended by teachers, or read aloud by parents to their children. This is, all around, a book that must be shared again and again, because it has a rare power to touch hearts and change minds. 
 The whole way the story is presented and the plot is unvailed before our eyes, is extremely clever, yet again, also terribly simple, which by all means, I believe it is the true strength of this work, its apparent simplicity. 
 You can feel the love that was put into this book in every single page, sentence and word. There's this aura around it that just caresses your heart. I don't know how to explain it properly. 
 I couldn't put it down all night, and even though it made me cry again and again, it also made me smile, it made me laugh, and reminded me of how precious and beautiful life is, and to never give up on people. There's always two sides to every story.

Wonder is one of the latter types of books. I finished this one in a day last weekend, and have struggled to find the words to review it ever since. 
 I first read a review of this book on GoodReads, written by the wonderful Wendy Darling, whose opinion on books I hold in high esteem. At the time, my library didn't yet have this book on order, since it was so new, but I immediately added the book to my TBR list. Once my copy arrived in the library, and I devoured it in a single day, I will definitely be purchasing a copy of this book, since I think it's a must-have for any library. 
 Wonder is a middle-grade novel that would appeal to any age group. I recommended it at work to a woman with an eight-year old son and to some of my much older coworkers. As Wendy so eloquently put in her review, this book can be recommended to anyone with a beating heart. It'll warm your heart, break it a little and then leave you with a feeling of absolute satisfaction and euphoria. After finishing this book, I immediately told my husband that all elementary schools should have this book as a novel study. If more kids read Wonder, I sincerely believe that there would be no more bullying. It's the kind of book that touches your heart and makes a difference. The kind of book that sticks with you long after the final words have been read. The kind of book that makes your soul sing and makes you happy to be a reader. The kind of book that comes around once in a while and reminds how profoundly we have an impact on the lives of one another. 
 I won't write anymore, since the slightest thoughts about the plot of this book have me tearing up all over again. But let me leave you with this: YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. If you read nothing else this year, read this one. It's, hands down, the best book that I've read this year.

 Wonder follows fifth grader August ""Auggie"" Pullman as he enters school for the first time. Auggie never went to school for medical reasons due to severe craniofacial anomalies that cause other people to stare or even scream at him. While Auggie sees himself as a normal fifth grade boy, many of his classmates do not-they refuse to be near him and are even afraid to accidentally touch him. Told through several points of views, readers learn about Auggie's story and how it affects every one around him. 
 There are so many reasons why I love this book. I love how the author uses multiple characters to tell the story so we can see how many different people react to Auggie and how they change because of his story. All of the characters are unique and none of them are perfect, which makes each character very authentic. Initially, I was disappointed that Julian didn't have a chapter, but after reading the author's reasoning on her website, I'm glad that she didn't (read her reasoning here). 
 Even though we don't get a Julian chapter, I think the emails from Julian's parents contrasted with Jack's story with his babysitter help us understand Julian's actions, even if we don't agree with them. It shows the large role that adults play in shaping children's opinions. I'm studying special education in college and whenever I tell people this, they automatically assume that I'm working with students who have no ability to learn any school content. In this book, Julian's parents just look at Auggie and assume he can't be learning the same material as their son, even though he outperforms many students in fifth grade. On the other hand, Jack experiences something completely different, which affects how he treats Auggie. All of the little stories in this book were so realistic and helped me better understand the character's motivations and actions. 
 I also enjoyed the precepts at the end of the book that were submitted by the students over the summer. I liked how they really showed each character's personality and for some it showed their growth. I was expecting the precepts to be part of the big moment at the ending, but I'm actually glad they weren't because it made the book less predictable. Also, the big moment at the end better suits the book. 
 Overall, Wonder is a wonderful story with a great message, so I give Wonder five out of five stars.

 By the end, when I shut the book, I actually wrapped my arms around it like I was hugging a very close friend (or would that be friends? haha). This review will not have any spoilers, so don't worry! Anyway, August is a 10 year old boy with extreme facial abnormalities. As the official summary states, he was not expected to survive. Over the years, he has never attended school due to numerous surgeries and it shocks him when he finds out that he was accepted into Beecher Prep. August was born into a very loving family, with a comedic father, a doting mother and a pretty protective elder sister. His sheltered life seems rather distant when he enters school. August knows who he is and what he looks like. He knows how he effects people and he is use to how people react to him, but in school, they really test his limit. 
 But there's always more to a face. 
 ""Wonder"" starts out with August's perspective, then moves to his elder sister, Via, then to a friend, and so on and so forth, but by the end of the book, it moves back to August. When I borrowed this book from my local library, I didn't know that the perspectives switched and if I knew, I don't think I would have read this. I'm always reluctant to read another person's point of view and I do hate that I'm like that because it is rather silly of me. And, now that you know this about me, you might be surprised that I actually read through everything without trouble. As each perspective transitioned to the next, I was introduced to new, wonderful characters. And these characters that Palacio writes so realistically, I can't tell you enough how much I fell in love with this book. It's the kind of story where you're left with this empty feeling and you're seeking for more, but you know that on your own, you can picture the character's life ahead. You can play the ideas, juggle all the roads the characters may possibly take. 
 These characters will touch your heart, and the kindness and meanness of the people that August comes across will both warm you and horrify you. This truly is a remarkable book, and I promise you, by the end of the story, you will learn something. 
 August truly is a wonder.","Thu Jan 02 07:15:51 -0800 2014","Thu Mar 26 11:44:41 -0700 2015","Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",0,0,"False"

As a mom, I can't even fathom what was going thru Isabel Pullman's mind when August was born with the severity of deformities he had. Granted, this is a fictional book, but it happens to be some people's realities. 
 ""The universe hasn't been kind to August Pullman"" was an understatement made by his friend Jack. No joke. Auggie's odds were 1 in 4 million. 27 surgeries before age 4. And a life time of horrified looks from strangers. How anyone keeps from tearing up during this read is beyond me. I found myself extremely grateful for my ""perfect"" babies, and wondering how exactly you can teach your children to be compassionate, as well as ""kinder than necessary"" like Summer, when there are so many Julian's?

 Wonder has been on my shelf for a long time- I happened to read a page of it while waiting for an email and two hours later I was still going. It's a joy of a book to read, super quick and easy but full of sweet messages, sadness and moving characters. 
 The book is split into different POVs, ranging from our main boy August, his sister, his best friends and Via's boyfriend. This worked incredibly well as we not only saw how August saw himself, but how the world around him saw and felt for August. 
 We start the book with August, and we end the book with August, who has a different look to him than the other boys and girls around him. Handling physical conditions such as this is extremely hard to do but Palazio handles it with great tenderness and delicacy and definitely shines truth on the reality of those involved. His journey involves him going to middle school for the first time, and learning to get on with children his own age. 
 Our little party of characters are truly real and representative of children who struggle not only to follow what they believe in but not to be led astray by others. 
 A lot of moments in this book touched me, I felt close to tears on a number of occasions, and had to hold my dog close - A LOT while reading. 
 It's a super quick read, - a great choice to get you out of a reading slump if you're in one. And it's a meaningful story I feel should be spread around - it'll touch your heart, warm your soul and make you realise how such small actions make the biggest difference.

 When I first heard about this book, the first thing that came to mind was the movie Mask. It is a favorite of mine, and I couldn't help it. I had to purchase this book. 
 It surprised me to see how strong Auggie was, even if he sometimes doubted himself. It must be so hard to be different, when you aren't different. Auggie wasn't an alien or a horse but a little boy like all the others. And although not everyone was able to realize that, I'm glad some did. 
 Be prepared to switch P.O.V as the author jumps from August, to his sister, her boyfriend, and some friends.","Thu Jan 17 10:35:06 -0800 2013","Wed Feb 06 12:53:59 -0800 2013","Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 -0800 2013",1,3,"False"

 It's the story about Auggie, and basically about his first time in public school. Like the synopsis told, Auggie is just an ordinary kid with an extraordinary face. You can imagine how hard it is for him. To start something so new, in a very new place, full of people who want to know you, not because any great things about you but because they curious about your face and your story. I should say curious because sometimes people didn't care, they just want to know it. They didn't really want to help you, they just need something to talk about with their friends. Another factor why I really like this book is because the writing style of the Author. It a light book I should say, and don't make me tired to read it even in a long time. I feels like this book should be categorized as children book than a young adult one. She write this book perfectly, from any different point of view of the characters in this book. The way she write in this book, explicitly told us that sometimes the way we saw something was different from the facts, the way we thought about something is different from what the other think, and the way we judge something is somehow not same at all with what it actually is. Prejudice is not a good thing at all. Stop act like you know it so much, when you actually don't know the reason other people did and feel about something.

 Hello Bookworms. I'm back with a special read to my heart, as I'm certain that you'll fall in love with it just like I did (or not). The lovely baby blue book up there is actually from the children's gender. Though it seems childish of me, but some books are just timeless. 
 I first spotted Wonder while I was skimming through some bookish themed Instagram accounts. The cover attracted me, mainly because it contained a half-faced boy. It reminded me of a Picasso painting too. This accord probably a year or two before I actually ordered it. I kind of regret my poor decision on not getting it sooner ( I always make poor decisions. But that's not the point here.) 
 The story takes place in the lives of the Pullmans. Normal parents, a normal daughter, a normal pet dog, and an extraordinary son called August. Auggie is a typical geeky child. He loves Star Wars and video games. August was homeschooled too. But why? well, let's just say that Auggie Pullman had an interesting face. Everything was going well for the little one, until one day his parents decided to enroll him into a normal middle school and make him have a taste of an ordinary school life. 
 He freaks out at first, but soon comes in terms with it. The boy meets new friends, and learns the meaning of true friendship. Auggie learns that sometimes enemies can be friends, and friends could be potential enemies. He faces challenges, bullying and loss. But Auggie Pullman smiles again, and gives a thumbs up. 
 Auggie's big sister faces some problems too, and most of them are unfortunately linked to her little brother. It is not easy being Auggie's normal sibling. 
 This book will make you laugh, cry, and laugh again. But most of all, it will make you walk away wishing you had your own Auggie. I practically fell in love with this fictional child. 
 Cool Beans!

For another, he doesn't look like your typical child. August was born with chromosomal differences, which means he has a deformed face. When his parents enroll him in a private school for the 5th grade, August (Auggie to his friends and family) is terrified. He is afraid that people will stare. They always stare. He is afraid of not making friends; of being picked on; of just being different. As if becoming a teenager isn't bad enough with hormones taking over, going to school while being different is just plain torture. But with humor and a lot of heart, August learns who his true friends are, and what Kindness really means. 
 This book is told from the points of view of August, his sister Via (Olivia), his friends Summer and Jack, and Via's friends Justin and Miranda. While this book was a little too lovey-dovey toward the end, it was realistic enough, and the message came through loud and clear.","Fri Mar 08 09:40:30 -0800 2013","Tue Mar 26 09:23:39 -0700 2013","Tue Mar 26 09:23:39 -0700 2013","Fri Mar 08 00:00:00 -0800 2013",1,0,""

You will laugh and cry as Auggie navigates a new world that is often cruel and embracing. As the mother of a 10 year old boy, I so felt the pain of Auggie's rejection and the pain of not being able to make his world free from this pain or of his unfortunate disfigurement. I was horrified trying to piece together just how awful Auggie's face is and wondered how I, or my son, would react in such a situation. A great topic for discussion between me and my son. 
 I would have given this 5 stars except for 2 issues for me. The author alternates in first person between multiple narrators and this works - but there are too many voices. I felt if she had selected 3 (Auggie, a friend, Auggie's sister) we would have enough of other points of view to see Auggie's world full circle. Also, the kids are 10 year olds in 5th grade but they seemed like 6th or even 7th graders with much older conversations than I hear 10 year olds having and especially navigating the dating world. I just couldnt suspend disbelief over that and kept thinking they were 12 or 13. 
 Overall, this book is a ""wonder"" and so is Auggie.","Sun Aug 18 11:07:29 -0700 2013","Tue Nov 26 02:58:31 -0800 2013","Thu Nov 21 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Tue Nov 19 00:00:00 -0800 2013",2,0,""

 I don't know how to review this book. I've read a lot of books that are about sensitive subjects that I can't review. The books are an experience. This one is a good experience. 
 Okay, but let's be real. I think EVERY student in middle school should be required to read this book. This is one of THOSE kinds of books. I already consider myself a kind enough person, but kids are learning and up until they start thinking for themselves, they learn behavior from their parents. And not all kids have good parents. 
 August Pullman is blessed to have amazing parents, a kind sister and open minded classmates. All his life he's known kindness, he's known exclusion.... and it didn't harden his heart. Because of his family, the love and support he received from them. 
 There's a lot to take away from this book, no matter what stage of life you're in. But the most important of all is: be kind, be loving, be yourself.","Tue Nov 12 08:53:22 -0800 2013","Wed Mar 29 15:02:06 -0700 2017","Wed Mar 29 15:02:06 -0700 2017","Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

Up until now he has been home-schooled by his mother due to the number of surgeries he's had to endure since he was a baby. Auggie was born with a severe birth defect requiring him to undergo 20+ surgeries in just under ten years. He knows how people look at him whenever they go out, and he's afraid of what will happen when he goes off to school - he won't know anyone there. What if the kids are scared of him? What if they talk about him? Will he have any friends? When Auggie's parents take him to Beecher Prep, just a few blocks away from his home to meet the principal, Mr. Tushman, he decides to give it a try. Besides, if it's too horrible, he can always go back to being home-schooled. 
 As if middle school isn't hard enough, imagine having to deal with Auggie's problems on top of the cliques and all of the pre-teen angst of middle school. This book is funny, heart-breaking and inspiring all at the same time. It's told from multiple viewpoints, and not once does it feel disjointed. In fact, the multiple points of view help round out the novel very well. I've read plenty of books about outcasts, but I don't think I've ever wanted to jump in and rescue someone as badly as I did with Auggie. This little guy has so much heart the reader can't help but love him. While this is a middle-grade novel, it's perfectly suited for any age. In fact, I would urge teens and adults to read it. It's powerful, well-written and has a message for all of us. I will be very surprised if this book doesn't win a few awards this year.

 Auggie is a 5th grader who tries to believe he's normal. But, he has extreme facial deformities from a genetic condition and he's been home schooled until now. So, there's the story about trying to fit in when everyone can't help but stare at you. Then, there's the story of just growing up and trying to fit in as a kid. 
 The different first person perspectives from the different children helped flesh out the story. Not only did I feel for, and like, Auggie a lot, I sympathized with his older sister, Olivia. It's not easy being the other sibling when your brother has been through countless surgeries and therapies.

 I loved every single character. 
 It was great to see not just Auggie's POV but also his friends' and family's. And I just loved every single one of them. If I could hug them all I would. 
 I think I'll just hug it after I've wiped all my tears away. 
 FR : Magnifique. 
 C'est un livre realiste, adorable et triste a la fois, qui montre ce que c'est d'etre unique, different des autres, comment on est notre famille le vit. C'est un rappel que le monde est rempli de personnes horribles, mais qu'il est aussi rempli de personnes merveilleuses qui rendent vivre une vie difficile, tellement plus simple. 
 J'ai adore absolument tous les personnages. C'etait super de ne pas seulement voir le point de vue de Auggie mais aussi de sa famille et ses amis. Et j'ai craque pour chacun des personnages. Si je pouvais tous les embrasser je le ferai. 
 Je crois d'ailleurs que je vais prendre un moment pour faire un calin au livre, une fois que j'aurai fini de pleurer.","Mon Aug 15 15:51:28 -0700 2016","Sun Sep 11 02:11:31 -0700 2016","Sun Aug 21 11:28:40 -0700 2016","Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 -0700 2016",2,0,""

As a book, I think it's pretty great! Augie's relationships with his friends and his sister are touching and interesting. The multiple POVs are sometimes too much. Summer and Olivia's chapters are especially great, although characters like Justin didn't need points of view here. To some degree, I think I would have enjoyed this ten thousand times more if I hadn't read it in middle school with a not-so-awesome english teacher. 
 Unfortunately, some of the issues are glossed over to a point where the novel loses its emotional heart. The book is too happy. The ending felt unearned, and moments of darkness feel out of place. For example, and this is a BIG spoiler, the dog dies and it's glossed over. 
 There's something about the message of the book that doesn't totally gel for me. It's not a negative message, per se, but it's not totally accurate either. This review says it better than I ever could. Books like Out Of My Mind by Sharon Draper focus on the fact that people who are different just want to be treated like people. And I'm not entirely convinced that any of these characters, besides maybe Summer and Olivia, treat Augie like a human being. In the end, he's still considered romantically unappealing and someone to be pitied by something like half their school. I'm not sure this is what the author was going for, but because of his classmates' dehumanizing behavior, Augie's happy ending rang slightly false to me. Obviously not all disabled people think the same, but it definitely contradicts with my thought process and at least a few reviewer's as well. 
 I still enjoyed the book, though, and I think many will.","Tue Oct 04 21:55:22 -0700 2016","Wed Aug 23 19:23:29 -0700 2017","Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013",4,1,"False"

 My Thoughts: Often times when a book is so critically acclaimed I'm a little hesitant to pick it up because more often than not the book just doesn't live up to the hype created around it. Yes, I've become a little cynical in my reading. 
 This is not the case with Wonder. Not by a long shot. 
 In fact two words that I initially wrote down after reading the first few chapters of this book were: 'touching and emotional'. It's because of the emotion and message behind this book that I'm so excited to share it with you. 
 First of all, I'm shocked and more than a little impressed that this book was written by a first time author. I think that a huge part of the success of this book is that Palacio has given Auggie (and the five other people who provide the narration) truly authentic and believable voices. 
 Auggie is an inspiring, funny and strong main character who will definitely stay with me for a long time. Palacio has created a sympathetic main character in Auggie who is a normal Star Wars loving boy with an extraordinary face who you can't help but root for. He's got a great support system at home which has instilled a strong sense of self and he uses his humour to deal with other people's issues with his face. He is exceptional in that he feels normal even though other people have more of an issue with his face. 
 ""I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary, I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. 
 But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go. If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that look-away thing. 
 Here's what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way."" 
 This book could very easily do a tailspin into a very woeful read about bullying. Sure it has it's emotional moments but it doesn't have a generally sad feel to it. It's actually a very uplifting read and has a much more simplistic and innocent approach to it that I wasn't expecting. If you're looking for a gritty account of what life is like living with a severe facial deformity then this won't be the book for you. 
 While there is a strong moral message in the book it never felt like Palacio was pontificating or shoving the moral down the reader's throat. It's a simple lesson: be kinder than you have to. I would hope that we all realize that we should be nice to everyone (even if we don't do it enough) but this book clearly shows the reader that the negative effects of 'looking away' or pretending we don't notice someone with a noticeable deformity is just as damaging as saying a mean statement. It was an emotional read at times (I even shed a tear or two!) but never had a saccharine or overdone feel to it. 
 It's because of the moral message that I think that this book should be read by middle school kids. I honestly think everyone should read it but kids in middle school would get the most out of it because I think it accurately portrays the effects of bullying, of ignoring someone based on their looks and shows how little it takes to just be a friend and uplift someone. To do what is right, not necessarily what is the easiest, or what others think you should do. Those are some pretty big lessons that I think ALL of us need to learn or get a refresher course on. 
 Overall I truly loved this book. I was fully emersed in Auggie's world from the beginning to the end and found it to be a very touching read. The story is told by these six characters with the use of short chapters that really helped to keep the pace moving. But what really stood out with me is the ease and success that Palacio had using various points of view -- Auggie and FIVE others -- to tell the story. This could have been a literary train wreck with the number of POVs but it was done extremely well giving the reader insight into those around Auggie and how he and they experienced things differently. 
 I especially loved his sister, Via's, point of view and her conflicting feelings towards her brother and all of the attention he gets from their parents. She adores her brother but the effects of his facial deformity, his numerous surgeries and how others react to him greatly influences her life. Palacio also shows how other people in Auggie's life, namely Jack and Summer, deal with other insensitive and downright cruel people who judge them for hanging out with Auggie. 
 I did have a couple of small criticisms about the book. One thing that did strike me as not quite right were the language and issues that these Grade 5 kids had to deal with. As a mom to kids in Grade 4, 6 and 8 I'd like to think that I have a handle on the voice and development of tweens. Based on that experience with my Small Humans I think that the social issues that were dealt with in the book are more in middle school (Grades 6-8) than in an elementary school setting. I don't think that Grade 5 students are nearly as developmentally advanced as Jack, Auggie, Summer etc were portrayed in the book. I think having the kids be in Grade 7 would have been a more realistic age where they would have experienced the peer and social pressures dealt with in this book. 
 My other issue with the book is that perhaps because it had a lighter feel to it the ending was also more uplifting and a little too tidy for my liking. The 'bad guy' got his comeuppance and the good guys all rode off into the sunset. These are small beefs about the book (wee 'moos', if you like) but they were noticeable and may bother some readers who were hoping for an edgy ending. 
 Overall, I loved this book and found Wonder to be truly wonderful. I adore the moral of the book that encourages people 'to be kinder than necessary' and that people have not only 'the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness'. Hopefully, after reading this book people will choose to be more respectful and kinder to others even when it's not convenient for them or when it makes them feel uncomfortable. To give others dignity. Imagine the kind of world we'd have if we all did that. 
 ""Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. 
 One should be kinder than needed."" 
 Highly recommended.

 I really wasn't expecting to love this book so much. I found myself being quickly swept up into the emotions of all the characters and ending had me smiling with tears in my eyes. This book taught a very powerful lesson though the eyes of ten year olds, which is really saying something about the author's writing skills. Wonder will be one of only a handful of books that the lessons it taught will go with me & really has left a lasting impression.

Pero lo mejor es que de eso no se trata este libro, mas bien se centra en el impacto que tiene August en la vida de quienes lo conocen. Y el impacto que tiene las reacciones de los demas en la vida de August. Me encontre con una lectura sencilla pero muy rica en ensenanzas, es de esas lecturas que desearias fuera obligatoria en todos los colegios. 
 Y hablando de impactos, creo que es una lectura que tiene un impacto positivo en todos aquellos que la leen. August tiene un efecto positivo en los lectores por su manera de ver las cosas y el buen humor con que afronta todo. A pesar de que hay momentos dificiles, su familia y amigos le dan la fortaleza para afrontarlos. Es una lectura que nos ensena a no tratar diferente a aquellos que no son iguales que nosotros y a tomar siempre la decision de ser amables. Ser amables no nos cuesta nada pero puede hacer una gran diferencia en los demas. 
 Me encanto que no solo podemos ver la historia desde el punto de vista de August, tambien podemos ver capitulos narrados por su hermana y sus amigos. Es ahi donde conocemos como ven los demas a August, que sienten respecto a el y por que deciden ser sus amigos cuando nadie mas quiere serlo. Lo que mas me gusto es poder leer como un nino que puede ser rechazado tan facilmente, tiene una influencia tan bonita en aquellos que lo conocen bien. Y aquellos que evitan compartir con August solo por ser ""deforme"" nunca conoceran los buenos y bellos sentimientos que tiene. 
 Una historia conmovedora, que tiene un ultimo mensaje: ser amables. En realidad August no es el del problema, son los demas. El es solo un nino como cualquier otro, con la particularidad de tener un rostro diferente. Es un nino hermoso, valiente, sensible, ama a su familia, valora a sus amigos, es AMABLE, aunque los demas no lo sean con el. 
 Yo de verdad empezare a recomendar este libro a todo el mundo, grandes y pequenos, empezando por ustedes. Todos pueden sacar de el un mensaje muy positivo que incluso puede cambiar totalmente la forma en que ven las cosas. A mi me paso. El final de este libro es hermoso, lleno de conjeturas que no hacen sino ensenarte lo valiosas que son esas personas que han llegado a este mundo luciendo diferente o con alguna enfermedad en particular, el verdadero sentido de ""Wonder"" o ""Maravilla"". Si todos tomaramos la decision de ser amables, no existiria tanta intolerancia, rechazo y discriminacion. Nadie es mejor que nadie, mucho menos por la forma en que se ve fisicamente. 
 Wonder es de esos libros que tienen un significado claro. Vale mucho la pena conocer a August, el hacerlo te permitira descubrir un poco mas de ti mismo. Si te gustan las historias que te dejan algo, este definitivamente es tu libro.","Thu Nov 01 11:01:22 -0700 2012","Sun Feb 23 16:34:24 -0800 2014","Thu Feb 06 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sun Feb 02 00:00:00 -0800 2014",1,0,""

 Plot: Auggie has multiple physical disorders that make him look different from the other children. After many corrective surgeries, he's finally healthy enough to attend middle school with other children. The book follows this transition, from friends who support him to bullies that do not. The book switches view from person to person, emphasizing a need for empathy and understanding.

The book is about friendship, hardship, courage, bullying, adolescent misunderstandings, and ultimately hope and love.","Thu Jul 14 22:27:08 -0700 2016","Wed Aug 10 21:39:13 -0700 2016","Wed Aug 10 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

 Ok, it's about a boy called August Pullman and he has a disfigured face. It's his first time going to school after being home-schooled and he hates it because everyone avoids him because of his face and he's trying to make friends but it's not working because nobody wants to look at him because of his face. 
 Interesting book but not what I normally like to read. I know I rated it 4 stars, so it seems as if I really like the book, but to be honest it's not too amazing.

It's hard to find something about the book that I didn't like. It has won several awards and rightly so! It's an easy read for middle school-aged students. It is very approachable, and not heavy-handed or preachy with the subject matter. 
 The main character is August, a boy who has always been home-schooled but who enters school in the fifth grade. While that would be enough of a meaty plot, August has severe facial deformities due to a genetic condition. Some description of this is given but, August, like the rest of us, seems to be his own worst critic. 
 The book is told from alternating points of view and this makes the story so much richer. (Dear teachers, this would be a great point-of-view lesson having certain groups read only one character.) I though Auggie's sister's (Vi's) chapters were the most powerful, but I really loved how all the different character's point of views painted a whole picture of August and his situation. I love that Palacio didn't pity her character or cut him any breaks. The brutality of the story made it seem more fair. 
 It is a book for either a boy or girl of any age. It has a universal appeal even though it's a situation not many can connect with, at least not initially The story shows the very best of childhood innocence and forgiveness. This story is also about the important topics of bullying and being a true friend, but also about acceptance, kindness and humanity. It's about looking beyond our own concept of outward beauty to see the true beauty within.","Mon Apr 15 07:37:46 -0700 2013","Tue Oct 15 14:09:00 -0700 2013","Tue Oct 15 14:09:00 -0700 2013","Mon Apr 15 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

 I read this book with no proper knowledge what to expect. I think that's the reason why I enjoyed this book so much. There was barley any info, so you have no choice other than to let yourself be surprised what story Palacio wants to tell. 
 The minute Auggie came into the picture and described how his every day life looked like, I was smitten. Sad, of course but eager to know more. And I got more. I got an insight into Auggies life, how he struggles and survives. How everyone around him reacts or handles what happened to him. Different point of views offered different kind of opinions. 
 And I was surprised how relatable they all were. My sister used to have a friend in primary school who had similar issues. She was a wonder, too. And I remember how insecure she was around us and how insecure I was. It was hard but once you saw through that ""wonder"" (I don't want to give any spoilers away so I just use this word) and really get to know this person there isn't really much to be insecure about. Every human looks different. Some more some less. That doesn't make them any less human. At the end of the day it doesn't matter how one looks. Because looks won't bond people. Looks can be deceiving. The way someone looks is like holding a colourful box. What really matters is the content in this box.

 Wow. Such an insightful read. 
 I have read a lot of books with multiple POVs but I have never liked or read a better one. There was so much that was gleaned just because we were given a peep into the heads of all these different characters. 
 This wasn't a book that kept me up late into the night reading, no it wasn't unputdownable or thrilling . It did not have a well crafted story that provided intrigue, No, it wasn't any of those things. It was a simple story about the everyday simple things that happened in the life of a simple boy. An Ordinary boy. I do believe that more than anything else this is the thrust of this book, to see and treat everyone around you as ordinary and normal. We sometimes forget and take it for granted how being just like everyone else could be a luxury. 
 Developing Kindness, understanding and perspective is what this book is all about. A story that might not have had me racing through the book just to know what would happen but one that would definitely stay with me for a long long time. 
 The chapters from Via and Jack's perspective were my favorite. And even though I wasn't a fan of the Julian chapter it is something that everyone should read, the end would be worth it. 
 You could love someone and yet at times be selfish and not like them for who they are, it did not make you evil it just made you human. And so long as you can pull through, hang on to the love and kindness you would be fine. 
 Wonder and Auggie will stay with me, for sure and whenever I see someone like Auggie I would remember to treat them just like I would treat anyone else.

 I wanted to like this book more than I did. I suppose I was hoping it was more like ""Anything But Typical"" by Nora Baskin, but it read a little more like ""Stargirl"" by Jerry Spinelli with a touch of ""The Fourth Stall."" 
 I didn't like the ending. 
 When we meet August (Auggie) Pullman at the start, he tells us his mama's story of his birth - the hospital doctor fainted at the sight of him, but a large ""farting"" nurse whispers into his mother's ear, ""Everyone born of God overcometh the world,"" and she yells at the doctor, flat on the floor, ""What kind of doctor are you? Get up! Get up!"" and her last fart wakes the doctor up. 
 Auggie was born with severe facial deformities and has had 28 surgeries up until his current age of 10 years old. But... ""My mother is pretty. My father is handsome. My sister is beautiful. IN case you were wondering."" He states. 
 Auggie's parents decide to take him out of homeschool and put him in 5th grade at Beecher Prep, a private Manhattan school, mostly because Auggie is smart and his surgeries are not precluding him from attending school anymore. 
 On his orientation day, Principal Mr. Tushman assigns 3 kids to take Auggie around the building - a girl and 2 boys, Jack Will and Julian Albans. Julian turns out to be a phony, but Jack Will seems to be a genuine friend, sitting next to Auggie in every class and joking with him. On Halloween, however, Auggie was supposed to arrive at school dressed as Jenga Fett. A last minute change of mind causes him to arrive as a ""Bleeding Scream"" and so no one sees him when he enters homeroom, and he overhears Jack talking to some other boys, saying ""If I looked like {Auggie} I think I'd kill myself."" Auggie rushes out of the room and goes home. 
 The friendship is eventually healed and the climax of the story comes at the fifth grade camping trip. The kids go to an outdoor screening of ""The Sound of Music"" at night, and Jack and Auggie go to find the restroom. With the line being unbelievably long, they head to the woods, where they are discovered by 7th grade bullies from another school. A fight ensues, and some of Auggie's classmates defend him, and the book ends with Auggie being applauded at the 5th grade graduation ceremony (5th grade graduation ceremony???) and receiving the award for best character. 
 Slightly suggestive material - his sister Olivia's boyfriend kisses her twice, and boys mention a girl being ""hot.""","Thu Jun 13 19:54:29 -0700 2013","Thu Jun 13 20:05:15 -0700 2013","Thu Jun 13 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,""

The book opens as he enters a mainstream school for the first time. He doesn't describe his face because, ""Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" Auggie wants to convince his new classmates that he's an ordinary kid, just like them. Easy to say, much harder to do. 
 If the grounding point of the story is Auggie's parents, who are warm and loving, then the heart of the story is Auggie's classmates, who are portrayed with such convincing realism, I figured the author must have a child that age at home. Bringing to life a bunch of fifth graders who have distinct personalities takes a lot of skill. (Also easy to say, much harder to do.)

 Sometimes you read a book and it doesn't seem like it will be groundbreaking or revolutionary or life-changing, but it's one you pick up simply because it looks interesting. That's what this book was for me-it has a lot of hype and is being made into a movie, so I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Plus it's more of a children's book, so I was just expecting to pass the time with a nice story. I wasn't wrong, but I couldn't have been more wrong. 
 One of the best things about this book is that it isn't the story itself (though that was amazing). I don't have to risk spilling spoilers to tell you about the book. The plot is straightforward and uncomplicated, and that's part of its beauty. 
 It's the way the story is told that will have you turning the last page while shedding happy tears. The switch between points of view, while remaining mostly from August's, enhances the story just enough. You're going to easily, and possibly without even realizing, fall in love with Auggie and his entire family. You'll see yourself in Jack, possibly Julian, and hopefully Summer. 
 I can go on and on about the simple beauty and quietly perception-altering qualities of this book, but I'll refrain and just tell you this: This book has already changed how I treat others.

 My only negative comment is that the students seem more advanced than 5th grade (speaking as a middle school teacher). And, I would have liked to read a chapter from one of the parent's POV.

 August is 10, and he's always been home-schooled, partly because he's had lots of medical procedures in his life, and partly to shield him from stranger's reactions to his face, which is severely deformed due to a rare combination of birth defects. At the beginning of the book, his mother wants him to try going to middle school, which he is at first opposed to. but then bravely embraces. Narration of the book is shared between August and other characters, his sister and about six or seven other young characters in the story, which was a brilliant decision on the part of the author. As a reader, you get to watch a whole community emerge, and you watch that community start to accept and then largely embrace him, after a few bumps. It was lovely and inspiring, a book with a huge potential for saccharine that wound up dodging it almost completely. We laughed, we cried, we talked about it.

Tokoh utamanya adalah August Pullman yang saat di kandungan mengalami mutasi gen, sehingga dia terlahir dalam kondisi berbeda dari orang-orang lain. Buku ini mengisahkan tentang bagaimana August harus menghadapi ""dunia"" dengan kondisinya yang berbeda. 
 ""Wonder"" ditulis dari beberapa sudut pandang. Ada sudut pandang August, Olivia (kakak August), Summer, Jack Will, Miranda, dan Justin. Saya paling suka cerita dari sudut pandang Olivia dan Jack Will, karena di situ terlihat bahwa setiap orang, sedekat apapun dan sebaik apapun, tetap punya kelemahan juga. 
 Buku ini tampaknya ditujukan untuk anak-anak atau remaja dewasa, jadi ya lebih banyak optimisnya ketimbang pesimisnya. Coba kalau ini untuk dewasa, kayaknya bakalan lebih banyak pesimisnya :p Karena keoptimisan yang terlalu berpendar-pendar itu *tsaaaah* saya kadang merasa buku ini ""too good to be true."" Tapi, mungkin memang ada yang semacam itu kali ya. 
 Oh iya, belakangan ini saya nyadar kalau hampir di tiap buku yang saya baca pasti ada tokoh guru yang menyenangkan. Kalau kemarin-kemarin di The Perks ada Mr.Anderson, lalu di Looking for Alaska ada Mr. Hyde, maka di Wonder, saya jatuh hati pada Mr.Browne dan monthly excerpts-nya.

They also led to his being home schooled for his grade school years. As he prepares for fifth grade his parents decide it is time for Auggie to face the world, but is the world ready for that face? The Pullmans have enrolled Auggie at Beecher Prep, a small, private middle school with a good reputation. The principal, Mr. Tushman, is kind and welcoming, but the same cannot be said of everyone at Beecher. Auggie is used to the shocked looks, the eyes that veer slightly away from his face, the forced smiles, and the overly-cheerful conversations that most adults use when they meet him. He has come to expect the taunts from other young people, but he hopes that going to school will give him the chance to show others that he is a normal boy despite his abnormal looks. 
 Shifting points of view elevate this book above the typical unfortunate protagonist sob story. Auggie opens the tale and proves himself to be bright, funny, and surprisingly well-balanced... a normal ten-year-old boy who just happens to have a severe facial anomaly. The situations and relationships that develop have the right feel, and the dialogue is realistic. Readers will laugh and cry with Auggie and then get a chance to see how others feel and think about him as the point of view shifts to his older sister Via, his pretty friend Summer, his supposed best friend Jack, and others. These contrasting perspectives reveal undercurrents and causal relationships that are missing or only hinted at in Auggie's telling. There is one narrator who seems ill-chosen... Justin contributes little or nothing to the plot and tone. It would have been a welcome substitute to have heard from the villain of the piece instead. But that is a small quibble, and perhaps it's asking too much of a writer to humanize the bully by sharing his thoughts and emotions with readers. 
 Bullying is of great concern in our schools and society. Despite many well-meaning programs, bullying continues, and adults often feel powerless to combat it. My mother used to tell the story of a little girl who prayed, ""Dear God, please help the bad people to be good, and help the good people to be kind."" Those words echoed through my head as I read Palacio's remarkable debut novel. This book deserves to be read and discussed in intermediate and middle school classrooms. Hopefully it will go a long way toward making that little girl's prayer a reality.","Mon Aug 06 19:13:59 -0700 2012","Mon Aug 06 20:24:28 -0700 2012","","",0,0,""

 When I first saw 'Wonder' sitting on a shelf at my local 'Kmart' I just knew I had to read it. But because I didn't have any money to buy it at that point in time... I had to leave it there, hoping that it would still be there in the next few weeks when I returned to buy it. But when I eventually came back... it wasn't there. 
 It took about a month to find it. But I believe it made me more than ever excited and determined to read it. 
 Okay so enough about me... 
 So 'Wonder' in my opinion is an extraordinary novel about a courageous young boy who has to live with a deformity. The way the novel is set out is in one word - perfect. I'd love to see a brave person make this into a movie one day... but leave the story exactly how it is. 
 This book made me laugh, made me cry (both happy and sad tears), made me angry (at the cruelty dished-out upon the main character) and my heart soar (expecially at the last few chapters). This is a beautiful book and I'm glad to see that there are authors out there that write with such honestly, understanding and love about any human being that struggles with a deformity or disability.","Thu Jun 28 00:25:19 -0700 2012","Wed Jul 11 04:12:51 -0700 2012","Wed Jul 11 04:12:51 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 08 11:01:01 -0700 2012",0,0,""

Books have had a profound and irrevocable impact on my life. I'm talking about the whole spectrum of words here: textbooks, dictionaries, fantasy, sci-fi, newspapers, magazines, diaries, emails, love letters, facebook status updates - the whole deal. 
 In in the many years I've been reading, I've been influenced. Influenced to love, to hatred, to sympathy, and sometimes, to tears. 
 'Wonder' by R.J. Palacio is, singularly, one of the best books I have ever read. It's not a literary masterpiece - no. It is a GOOD book. It resonates kindness and love and overcoming our fears, and so much more. Now, I won't give away anything from the plot. All you need to know is this: 
 'Wonder' is the story of a boy, August, who goes to school for the first time in the fifth grade (having been homeschooled before then). We follow August, or Auggie, as he is affectionately named, through his year at school - through the turmoils and troubles of a young teenager. 
 The catch is that Auggie is ""deformed"" - as the meaner kids in school call him. He suffers from multiple genetic mutations that have resulted in him having a very unusual face. So, dear, reader, be prepared for the bullies, the name-calling, the self-loathing. It's all there, and it's all extremely powerful stuff. 
 R.J. Palacio has done an immaculate job with this book. I am so thankful to have stumbled upon it. I recommend this read to any and every person. It has changed me. It has brought me to tears. 
 My personal favourite part of this book is Auggie's English teacher, Mr Browne, who has a precept for every month. I'm not going to put them in here, for fear of spoiling the thrill of uncovering them for the reader, but if you're interested in reading 23 statements that will make you laugh, make you nod your head in assent, and if you apply them, make you a better person, click through to my blog here: http://geishahouse.me/2013/07/16/revi...","Wed Jul 10 12:54:13 -0700 2013","Tue Jul 16 05:26:30 -0700 2013","Tue Jul 16 05:26:30 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

I didn't care for the short chapters, but the format was ideal for a middle school reader. I also recognize that Auggie's experience came from one of white, wealthy privilege so his story was quite different than other perspectives may have been. I also wasn't crazy about how everything wrapped up in a perfect bow, yet sometimes it is nice to have a nice, happy ending. All this I could overlook. My biggest complaint was that, while Auggie maintained that he was just a normal kid who looked abnormal, other people around him succumbed to the idea that those who struggle are inherently better/more special than everyone else.

I've found myself thinking back to the book fairly often this week. I had major facial trauma a few years ago and had my entire face reconstructed. One of my eyes will never look ok and my face is scarred up but there are people with deformities that are a lot more striking. It takes so much courage to go through life with the type of facial differences Augie has. I enjoyed hearing the stories from different perspectives. This is a story that could easily have turned soppy but I don't think it did. I pray that noone tries to make a movie out of it, even though it would work well as a screenplay. Augie says near the beginning that he won't describe what he looks like, ""Whatever you're imagining it's probably worse"".

The protagonist is Auggie a young boy who suffers from severe facial deformalities. He is going to be enrolled in a public school for the first time ever. Auggie is used to stares, but school puts him in a whole new spotlight. Auggie struggles to make friends and deal with the casual cruelty of his peers. Auggie's first section ends with him understanding that his parents love cannot save him from people. The book switches narrators and includes Auggie's sister Olivia (Via) who while blunt is honest. She explains how their parents have always overprotected Auggie and how it feels to play second fiddle to a child with special needs. Other narrators include Via's boyfriend, Summer the beautiful girl who sits with Auggie at lunch and becomes his friend, and his friend Jack. The narration always returns to Auggie as it is his story, but the format really works and allows readers to get a full picture of Auggie.

Auggie challenges his fellow fifth grade students, teachers, and parents to look past appearances and instead focus on what's underneath.

 How do I start? How about with the fact that this book pulls me to tears every time I read it...? Or with the fact that I can't choose a favorite character because they're all so perfect?!? 
 This book is AMAZING! I have no words for it. Um let's see what do I say now? Oh I know! I'll start with characters! Because those always a good place to start. ;) 
 Characters: 
 August (Auggie): For some reason August is one of my least favorite characters. I don't know why but I don't like him as much... But I still love him a lot. He's so brave and when the whole school is against him (well, except Summer) he is still willing to go to school, even if it takes convincing) He's funny and is willing to laugh about himself. A lot of people is this world are so insecure that they take everything too seriously and only laugh about others and never about themselves. This is an important part of August that I love. 
 Olivia (Viva): I really like her. She's human. Viva is a really cool human being, she's learned how to get by on her own. She's trying to be strong and trying not to cause any more problems for her family. And yes sometimes she breaks down but that's because she's a real person! And she needs confront and someone to be friends with her! I totally get what happens to her and Miranda. Friends change. And it's confusing sometimes. So you find new friends. And sometimes they're not as good as your old friends. So basically, life's complicated, and she has no one to help her through it. 
 Summer: Summer is a beautiful human being. She's what I wish I was. She dies t care what people think, she defends her friends and she's fun. She is kind and wonderful and I don't have any more words for her... 
 Jack Will (or just Jack): OH MY GOSH I LOVE HIM. (Ok so maybe I do have a favorite. Sue me) So at first I was like: Eh, nothing super special. Then I was like: I LOVE YOU, YOU ARE MY BABY MUFFIN. Let me explain why: 
 Jack is a normal kid, he's scared of judgment. I am too. I get it. At first I didn't like him as much because he didn't even want to give August a chance. Then he learned how cool August is and became friends with him. And when Jack Will said those awful things about August, I cried. A lot. But then he punched Julian and I loved him all over again. So there's that. 
 Ok so I realized I can't do all the characters because there are like sooo many... So I'll just wrap up here. 
 So overall this book is great and you should read it! And also, this review was written with a ton of feels so it's kinda biased... As most of my reviews will be. Anyway, I hope you guys have a good day and have some ice cream or something?","Fri Aug 05 10:13:38 -0700 2016","Fri Aug 05 11:05:07 -0700 2016","","",0,0,"False"

 Wonder is quite frankly an amazing book that well and truly deserves its place on the Carnegie Shortlist. I read the book in a night and needed copious amounts of tissues as I neared the end. It should be made clear however that this is not a sad book, instead it is one that highlights the better side of human nature. Although the darker side does raise its ugly head from time to time, this book shows how human kindness can overcome it. Yes there are parts that are quite corny and twee, but I was left with such a feeling of hope after finishing the book, so much so that the corniness didn't really seem to matter. 
 Auggie is the main character in the book, even when we read from the point of view of other characters. Born with a severe facial deformity he has had a lot to overcome in his 10 years. Previously homeschooled his parents decide to that now is the time he should start at mainstream school. Auggie is apprehensive but decides to give it a go, it's not like he isn't used to the way that people look at him. Initially ostracized there are a couple of pockets of light in the dark. In the end, despite the wishes of a boy who is obviously scared of being different, Auggie gains the acceptance of his classmates by showing a incredible quiet strength. 
 Wonder is written from the perspective of a number of central characters, all people whose lives have been touched by Auggie. I did miss the perspective of Auggie's parents but at the end of the day this is a book for pre teens not for adults and the characters that they would wish to hear from are all covered. All points of view were written in the first person, but I always knew whose voice I was hearing. I liked the way that this was done, I don't think that the book would have had nearly as much impact has it all been written from Auggie's point of view as a large part of the storyline was how he, as a person, affected the lives of those around him. I also think that the decision to write the book in the first person was a good one. It is a very emotive book about a very emotive subject, the first person narrative reinforced this as the reader feels an intense emotional connection to what is going on. 
 I also liked the fact that although this book focuses on the better side of human nature, the 'good' characters weren't perfect. Via sometimes resents her brother for taking her parents attention away from her and whilst she loves her brother doesn't always want the hassle that being seen with him brings, their parents disagree on Auggie starting school, Jack gives in to peer pressure and talks about Auggie behind his back and Auggie does feel anger and resentment at the lot that he has been given. Had these characters not had these little imperfections then Wonder would not have seemed as real and I don't think it would have succeeded in putting across the message that we should all take time to look at who a person is as that is what counts. 
 I'm not sure that it will win Carnegie, I think it may be a little sentimental to actually win the prize. It has however been a welcome break from the heavy darkness that can be found in some of the other books on the shortlist. And although I don't think it will win part of me wishes that it would 
 Verdict: A beautifully written, emotional book that give me hope for the nature of human kindness.","Thu May 09 05:37:42 -0700 2013","Thu May 09 05:38:31 -0700 2013","","",0,0,""

 August ""Auggie"" Pullman started the fifth grade. This story is about his experience going ""mainstream"" after being home-schooled. This can be the usual YA/coming-of-age fiction except for the part that Auggie was born with a congenital defect that distorted his face, thus, earning him several rude nicknames from other kids. ""Wonder"" tells how Auggie faced (no pun intended) the challenges of meeting new people and learning (the hard way) who among those are true friends. We have all gone through that challenge at least once in our lives. 
 This book is well-written. There are chapters that show other characters' points of view. It's fun to read through them while keeping in mind the personalities of these characters. This story inspiring. Those who have been bullied or judged because of physical appearance can relate to Auggie's experiences. Surprisingly, I was touched by the ending. I didn't expect this book to make me cry, but I guess a little bit of kindness and a lesson on kindness can go a long way.","Wed Aug 06 08:40:56 -0700 2014","Tue Aug 12 08:46:36 -0700 2014","Tue Aug 12 08:46:36 -0700 2014","Wed Aug 06 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 What was exceptional about this book, however, is that the story is told from multiple points of view. August starts us off giving us background to his life and surgeries as well as his own reflection of how not being ""normal"" or at least looking ""normal"" has affected him. Then we hear from his older sister, Via, who is starting high school and has issues of her own. I like how the book spans these these grades. Next Summer, one of August' new friends, adds her own voice followed by August's newest best friend, Jack. There' a lot of drama with the boys in this grade and I like that this book first of all sounds like the age group of the kids (versus an author trying to impress the reader) and that boys have social issues just as girls do.

 Mr Browne's Precept: 
 ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."" 
 and from Mr. Tushman's (the school principal) speech: 
 ""...kinder than is necessary. Because it is not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed...that concept reminds me that we carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness..."" 
 When I read that I just had to stop and think about that particular quote for a moment. It is so true, kindness is a choice. This book showed that although we may not get to choose what we are, what we look like or even who are family is, but we do get to choose WHO we are. And we can choose to be kind. 
 This book is written for middle grade students, or upper primary, and it is done so beautifully, but I think that everyone should read it. It definitely goes under the Must Read category.

 I'm blown away by this book and the different points of view. Each character around him provide a different perspective on his experiences and how he shapes them. It's a powerful book on kindness.

 My main question is this: in a work of fiction that doesn't claim to have done any research or be based on one individual's true experience, why is it being considered a good example of how disabled or disfigured people feel inside? It's being hailed as a key to understanding what people with disabilities feel like so we can respond better. And I totally support that. 
 But how do we know that it's what they feel like? The book is fiction, with no citations or reference to any explanation of a real-life source. The kid is an invented person, with invented thoughts and feelings. Also, if there WERE a real-life basis why would we assume that most people in that situation would feel the same as he does, in a way that could be represented by one character? 
 I think it is very worthy of praise and I loved the story, but to me it is an eye-opening story that makes me feel more compassionate and aware of my own reactions and behaviors. Not a sneak-peek into a specific group's mind or feelings. 
 I am also one of those people who is uncomfortable with ""disability tourism"": holding people with disabilities up as a source for pity or inspiration. Not that they can't ever spark those feelings, but that emotional entertainment is not their main purpose in life. I'd rather let the person tell me what role they'd like to play in society, just like anyone else. I thought the book wasnt the biggest offender I've ever seen, but invited the reader to take it to a new level if they wanted to.","Mon Apr 14 17:03:43 -0700 2014","Wed May 24 19:36:29 -0700 2017","Wed Jul 17 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"False"

Whether we are 'normal' looking or not, we can never know what it is like to walk in someone else's shoes and should treat everyone with kindness and respect.

 I was worried when starting this book because it's a middle grade. And although there are plenty great middle grade books out there, as a 24 year old it's hard for me to fully appreciate the book because I'm not the right age demographic. However, Wonder is a great exception. 
 This book had me tearing up a few times. It was so heartwarming and real. I really liked that most of the characters were very realistic. Sometimes with middle grade books the ""popular"" kids are just mean without a realistic explanation or the characters feel flat. But with Wonder you get to understand why the kids who are mean to August are the way they are. You see it with Julien and his parents. Because he was raised and surrounded by such negativity and judgmental behavior it's what he mimics. 
 The characters were great. August was such a sweetheart, Jack was super adorable, Summer was this little sweetheart. I loved it. 
 I would recommend this book to anyone with kids (especially in or about to be in middle school). This is a great book to help kids understand how to be compassionate and kind to people even if your first instinct is to be detached or judgmental because someone is different. I think more kids need to read more stories like this, but also more parents. This book does a great job showing that sure, kids can be little jerks, but if that behavior isn't corrected they turn into adults who are jerks. 
 The whole Daisy part had me in tears. I'm a blubbering mess when it comes to dying dog stories. And for stories where someone gets a new dog. Gah. You best believe I cuddled my pup for ten minutes after Daisy passed. 
 My only con is that Justin's chapters drove me nuts with the weird lowercase format. Olivia was capitalized once (but all the other times it wasn't) and the rest of it is lowercase. I kind of hated it. But I enjoyed the content of the chapters. 
 Quotes I enjoyed: 
 ""Sometimes you don't have to mean to hurt someone to hurt someone."" 
 ""Funny how sometimes you worry a lot about something and it turns out to be nothing.""

August has a disfigurement that has caused his face to look lopsided that no amount of surgery can fix. Yet on the inside, he is just your average ten year old boy obsessed with Star Wars and playing video games. Here's a story where people matter, and where the boy wonder is as intelligent as any adult. 
 I can't help but smile at the tenacity and strength that August has. No matter what brought him down, he was right back up again. At times he felt like a punching bag, where kids would bring him down just for the fun of it. Yet August didn't let it get to him. He knows he may look different, but just because he does, doesn't mean he is. His whole personality is reflected in the eyes of the rest of the characters in the latter half of the novel which I enjoyed immensely. Considering there are a couple of characters, it didn't feel confusing, it just felt real. You felt what they felt, especially in August's point of view.

There is a lot to love about this book. It just isn't my type of book. It reminds me of cake. One piece of cake is great, but if you try to eat an entire cake by yourself, you'll get sick. This book is so sweet that it made me a little sick. I know that it's a middle grade novel, and those are supposed to have happy endings, but even as a child, I would have had a hard time with all the crying and hugging at the end. I was hoping that this book would be grittier, more realistic, and more honest. The premise is intriguing, but the book is unrealistically sweet and a little simplistic. 
 Wonder is about ten-year-old August. He is born with a genetic disorder that deforms his face and requires him to have dozens of surgeries. As a result, his parents homeschool him until it's time for middle school. August looks different from other children. At middle school, he faces bullying, discrimination, stares, and whispers. Over the course of a year, August grows up a lot, and the other children learn to be kinder. 
 The story is told from multiple points-of-view. I like this because it allows the reader to see August from different angles. My favorite narrators are Via and Jack. They feel the most honest to me. Both of them care about August, but they acknowledge that having him in their lives makes life more difficult. This is especially true for August's sister, Via. August requires so much attention that Via feels neglected by her parents. Via and Jack's points-of-view are very well done. Some of the other narrators have voices that sound very similar, so I would have liked them better if they were more distinct. 
 The sweetness is my main complaint about the book, but I also started to question the motives of August's ""friends"" as I was reading. The adult characters often tell the child characters to be kind to August. Are the other children friends with August because they like him as a person or because they have been told over and over to be kind to him? I question if the friendships in this book are real friendships. The older girl, Miranda, feels like an authentic friend to August, but I'm not sure about the others. To me, they seem like pity friends who are being kind to August because it's the right thing to do. Kindness is great, but wouldn't August want actual friends and not just people who are kind to him? It really bothers me that August says that he feels like a ""mascot"" to the other kids. He shouldn't be a mascot to the other kids; he should just be one of the kids. 
 Then there's the dating thing. Ten-year-olds do date. When I was ten, I remember that there was a lot of pressure to have your first kiss, bring a date to the sock hop, etc. The fact that ten-year-olds date in this book doesn't bother me. I'm also happy that some of the ten-year-olds in the book don't date. When I was ten, I thought that something was wrong with me because I had no interest in dating. I would have loved to read about characters who were similar to me. 
 This is going to sound hypocritical: it bothers me that August has very few thoughts about dating. He doesn't seem to have any crushes. He doesn't seem to feel any pressure to date. He doesn't seem to have any opinions about his friends dating. He doesn't seem to give much thought to possibly dating in the future. The author puts the other characters in relationships and totally ignores August's romantic life. I didn't like that.

 I'll start off by saying that the writing in Wonder was so breezy and effortless. It was such a simple read that packs such a strong message. I think this book perfectly captures that kids can be cruel and they can also be a lot stronger than they seem. 
 I liked reading the different perspectives within the novel. I liked reading from August's perspective the most but I also enjoyed reading from Via's. I liked being able to see the whole impact of August's condition, not just on Auggie, but on those around him, too. 
 Via's POV was really insightful because you were able to get a better understanding as to where she was coming from with her anger and it was nice to see the story from her side. I also felt like the changing perspectives helped with the pacing of the story. 
 The character development in Wonder was great; you watch August go from this shy self-conscious kid as he grows to find himself and become more comfortable around the other kids in his class. Jack Will and Via had some pretty nice character development, too, with both of them dealing with the effects of August in different ways, while also navigating their own lives. 
 This is a great book for all ages. I thought I would have a little trouble connecting to the characters because they're all 10 but it surprisingly wasn't an issue at all. I actually found Auggie's friend Summer to be really relatable. 
 There were times where the book made me laugh, made me angry, and even made me sad. But, all in all, this was a fantastic read. 
 I definitely feel like this book opened my eyes to just how cruel the world can be and why it's so important to remember to choose kindness.","Sun Oct 16 10:04:48 -0700 2016","Mon Jul 10 18:59:00 -0700 2017","Mon Jul 10 18:55:06 -0700 2017","Sun Jun 25 21:19:56 -0700 2017",0,0,"False"

It's a good illustration of how bullying can be a passive behavior as much as an active behavior, and the things you don't do can hurt as much as the things you do. 
 I was not a huge fan of the shifting narrations of this story. I didn't find any of the other points of view interesting or particularly relevant. Because there was such an imbalance between the amount of time spent on them and the amount of time spent on Auggie, it felt really jarring whenever we shifted to someone else. I feel that Palacio did a fine enough job illustrating how the other characters felt through Auggie's eyes, and those chapters probably could have been cut, and the book could have been shorter. It felt a little long and rambling.

 Now, this book is so highly praised, that there isn't anything more I can really say about it except that I like it the more I think about it. However, I do have a few things to point out. 
 1. August's family reminds me so much of my family. We aren't small (there is like 10 of us), and we don't have as much drama as the Pullman family (because my mom won't put up with crap). But when it goes into the perspectives of people like Jack and Justin, they marvel at how comfortable they feel around the Pullman's. They describe them as always telling each other that they love each other and finding fun in most situations. My family is a lot like that and I've had all my friends tell me they wish they had my parents and lived in my family because we spread the love. I really appreciated that in this book. 
 2. What I 
 didn't 
 like about this was how the children didn't tell in anyone what was going on! I was home schooled all the way through high school so I have no experience with a public school environment, but do kids really NOT TELL the teachers, or even their parents, what's going on?! It's ridiculous! 
 But that personal hiccup isn't enough to knock off a star for this book because it is such a gem. I loved it, everyone else here loves it, so go read it.","Mon Dec 09 21:50:25 -0800 2013","Sun Jul 17 01:19:44 -0700 2016","Sun Dec 22 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Wed Dec 18 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,"False"

 Here's what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way. 
 ---Auggie Pullman 
 August or Auggie isn't ordinary. His face is deformed due to a certain genetic mutation in which made Auggie underwent numerous surgeries since infancy. Those surgeries and operations are also the reason why he was homeschooled by her mother. Yes, it wasn't because of his physical appearance that he's forced to not go to school 
 So now that he wouldn't have to have any surgery in the near future, Auggie can go to school. And he's not excited about it. His parents thinks he's extraordinary, his sister thinks the same (or that's what she said). But in his new school, he was branded by numerous names possible that somehow associated with his physical appearance. 
 We'd see Auggie learned a valuable lesson about life and how hard it can be (not that it was easy for him before). He'd learned how cruel people can be, but he'd also meet good people. And he'd learn that no matter what people see in him, good or bad, doesn't change the fact that he is a WONDER. 
 Intriguing and brilliant. Simple yet with deep meaning. Excellent illustration of the treasure hidden beneath the covers. 
 I am conflicted, to be honest. Here's the thing, I looooooved the book. It made me cry, sob, sniffed a lot, pray and think about things. So if I'd rate it because of that, it's FIVE PERFECT TEAR-JERKING STARS but I know I shouldn't based alone on the emotions it awoke in me. (especially that I sometime get emotional over petty things) So if I'd rate it, forgetting that I cried over it, then I'll give it a three. 
 There's a great plot but then where is it? Intriguing? The thing is I praise the author for having this very unique idea of a plot. By the way, I wouldn't explain about it much because (1.) I don't understand it that much. LOL :) 2.) It's somehow hard to spell. LOL again, :) 3.) You have to find it yourself because it's amazing to learn about something new by yourself. I was like 
 'wows' 
 and 
 'aaahhh' 
 , along with nodding and eyes-widening.) 
 But as I said, the plot that I was hoping I would find wasn't there. It's like we're just given a glimpse of Auggie's life-a very important part of his life where he is beginning to deal with real world outside his home. It wasn't that great as a plot, but it was a great story. I know I'm not making much sense but READ IT. There were no surprising scenes or anything. But it deserves the hype, the praises, and all other glories it got. :) 
 The character are pretty predictable. You know they'd do it when and where. You know they'd feel it, how and why. But isn't it amazing that I still find myself rooting for each of them despite that? 
 Auggie broke my heart and I wanna adopt him someday. And made him feel that he is indeed a wonder. But then again his parents, sister, sister's friends, friends, teachers are already doing that job for me. And seriously, all of them deserves a medal too. 
 Especially JACK, Auggie's friend. Honestly, he's the one who I think has the best character development. 
 His sister, Via, reminded me of MY SISTER'S KEEPER by Jodi Piccoult. She was often neglected that had learned to just take care of herself. Her one outburst was really understandable and made me really cry. She's a very loving sister. 
 And I should mention Mr. Browne and his Precepts: Brilliant and helpful. 
 This is a story of an ordinary boy, who has an extraordinary heart and courage; of a boy with deformities yet can form strong bonds with people around him. This is an uplifting and heartwarming, yet heart-wrenching story of family, friendship, hope, acceptance, courage and beauty. This reminds me of a cup of black coffee, strong yet warm and comforting. Wonder is a story I will reread someday, maybe when I need to cry, or when I simply need a reminder to be good. And when I lose hope with humanity. (dang, that matters a lot) 
 Except for the obvious which is to be good and don't based on physical appearance, I think the author wanted to show us that no matter how much we find it hard to deal with a certain phase our lives(say teeanage), it's way even harder for others. It takes courage to conquer life. The following quote from Auggie says it all: 
 But hey, if they want to give me a medal for being me, that's okay. I'll take it. I didn't destroy a Death Star or anything like that, but I did just get through the fifth grade. And that's not easy, even if you're not me.

 ""Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle,"" said someone or other (probably Ian McLaren and not Plato.) Whoever put them together, those words kept coming to mind as I read Wonder - and not only for the most obvious reason. 
 Clearly, Auggie (August) Pullman is fighting a battle. His facial deformities and their associated medical complications have kept him out of school for the first ten years of his life. As the novel opens, he is set to enter fifth grade at a small private school in New York. This is a recipe for disaster, both interpersonal and literary. As many reviewers have noted, it's not easy to write a ""kid with a conspicuous medical problem"" novel and have it turn out anything but lurid or preachy. 
 Part of what keeps Wonder from that fate is the broadness and universality of its themes. At first, we see the world through Auggie's eyes - we are immersed in his battles. Then the perspective shifts, and we are in the head of his older sister, Via. Then Auggie's schoolmate, Jack. Then several other characters. With each one, we become aware that though Auggie's problems are the most conspicuous ones, he's not the only one struggling. Everyone is fighting a hard battle. Kindness given and received; courage in the face of social pressure - these themes are woven so tightly into the fabric of the book that it transcends the ""problem novel"" genre and becomes, like the very best books, a meditation on the nature of humanity. 
 That makes it sound heavier than it is, though. Palacio makes her point with humor, Magnetic Fields lyrics, and an impressively light touch. Short chapters, direct language, and skillful pacing make the book seem much shorter than its 320 pages. And the dialogue and social interactions ring true. I've taught fifth graders - in a private school, at that - and this is how they talk. This is how they act. It is also, without giving too much away, the way certain private school parents act. 
 Some people will say that the resolution is too neat, but I think it's appropriate for a middle-grade novel. I think the turning of the social tide is believable, and I think Auggie and Palacio earn their happy endings.

It's one of those coming-of-age stories that tackles issues of prejudice, self-discovery and morality which has the potential to be dull and cliched, but it has several moments that make you want to whoop and punch the air. 
 There are many different voices speaking around the issue of facial disfigurement but it's really August, the protagonist of the story that keeps you turning the pages. He's witty, brave and understanding of his situation. Best of all he's understanding of the struggles others have with his physical appearance and shows so much resilience and patience that he is a central character worth investing in emotionally. Love 'im. 
 Surrounding August, there's pressures of society and the war of intolerance vs acceptance being raged around him (look out for the right honourable Headmaster and Julian, the vile classmate - not to mention his equally as vile mother!) but don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple story of heroes and villians. It's great for young people because the author gives us characters still making their minds up (like the readers) and showing several of the personality 'tropes' that you will probably find in any school. 
 It's all what you would except from books of this genre, but it's well written and highly uplifting. A hearty recommendation from me!","Thu Mar 01 13:13:17 -0800 2012","Thu Apr 04 10:59:06 -0700 2013","Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2012","",0,0,""

August ""Auggie"" Pullman was born with a rare and debilitating facial deformity. Something of an urban legend in his north Manhattan community, Auggie is going to public school for the first time - middle school. The nebulous world of hormones and awkwardness mixed with social stigma and conformity. 
 Not only is this a story of Auggie's strength and courage, but the journey his classmates and family have to make to not only accept Auggie but to accept themselves. The journey outward always begins within.

 The book is in several sections, each from the point of view of a different character. These sections are well written and Palacio writes convincing characters with individual voices. I also like the fact that each section is split into very short chapters - it makes the book seem very quickly paced. 
 At times, it can be a little American and cheesey - especially at the end - but on the whole it avoids that and the central message of the book is one that I really like - that it's important to be kind.

I am not certain if the book is categorized as young adult, but it would make a worth-while read for kids. In fact, I have volunteered to work on a bullying project and believe this book is a great one to add to a suggested reading list. 
 Ok, enough of the stuffy, clinical review and more of the nitty-gritty.... 
 I dare you to read this book and not cry. This is the story of a champion. A little 5th grade boy named Auggie who was born with severe facial deformities. He is perfectly functional in every way, minus complications from his cleft palate and other structural problems that interfere with development (for instance, because his ears are malformed, he has hearing problems though these are easily corrected with hearing aids). Auggie understands that when people see him their reactions run the spectrum from outright screams to polite but notable pauses as people take in what they are seeing. Yet, this little boy has the most terrific sense of humor and sensitivity that just steals your heart. I think the author wrote it best: 
 Justin notes regarding the outstanding chances of Auggie's facial predicament, ""so doesn't that make the universe a giant lottery then?...my head swirls on this, but softer thoughts soothe...no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. like with parents who adore you blindly. and a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. and a little gravelly-voiced kids whose friends have left him over you. and even a pink-haird girl who carries your picture in her wallet. maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds"" (Palacio 2012, p. 204, lack of capitals author's choice). 
 Justin is speaking of Auggie's family and friends who look past Auggie's face to find the human worth knowing and worth being friends with, because without Auggie, their lives would be so much less. 
 Read this book. It is not a difficult or challenging read. You can read it on vacation or at the beach. It makes you feel good about people, because there are good people in this world. Auggie's principal gives the following J. M. Barrie quote at 5th grade graduation: ""Shall we make a new rule of life...always try to be a littler kinder than is necessary?"" (Palacio 2012, p. 299). Isn't that what makes life wonderful? Being a little kinder than needed and enjoying the gift of friendship, love, and enjoyment in return? 
 Auggie has the last word in the book and I think it is going on my wall of favorite quotes. He says, ""Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world."" Well said, Auggie...very well said.","Sun May 06 05:38:31 -0700 2012","Thu May 10 18:35:32 -0700 2012","Thu May 10 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Sun May 06 00:00:00 -0700 2012",1,0,""

 Nothing could have prepared me for the simple and powerful story in these pages. As a fifth grade teacher, reading about fifth graders, from the first-person perspective of fifth graders, I am simply amazed by how RJ Palacio knows these children. 
 Initially I rated Wonder 5 stars, but on further reflection I reduced it to 4. The ending of Wonder is just a bit too Mighty Ducks for me: ""And everyone lived happily ever after."" That's nice and feels good, but it's just not very real. 
 I really want to share this book with my class. I love how it illustrates the complexities surrounding motivations and impacts of our actions. I also found her portrayal of social dynamics at this age to be both accuracte and instructive.

Unlike his classmates Auggie has been home schooled up until now. This will be his first time attending school. Being the new kid is always hard, but for Auggie, it's twice as hard. August Pullman got the rotten end of the gene pool and was born with a severe facial deformity. When the going gets tough, Auggie sticks it out and ends up surprising both himself and those around him. 
 The majority of the time, we judge people based on their looks. In our society, the better looking you are, the more popular you tend be. August Pullman shows us why that is not always the case. 
 This book is tended for middle schoolers, however, I feel it should be required reading for high school students and adults as well. The theme here, as R.J. Pullman puts it ""Don't judge a boy by his face.""

He is a bright boy and has been home-schooled over the years, but now it has been decided that it is in his best interest to attend fifth grade at Beecher Prep School--which is like leading a lamb to slaughter. The story Wonder is the story of the great courage and character it took for this fragile boy to face the harsh, often cruel and judgmental world of the schoolyard, one day at a time, and not only survive, but prosper. 
 It is a very moving story and probably a good one for middle-school children to read to learn more about what it feels like to be so different on the outside yet only desiring to be seen as normal and to be accepted. 
 The book and its happy ending struck me as a bit pollyannic though. We all know children who were never accepted by their peers because they were different in some way and came through their school years with scars and wounds. The tragedy of school shootings shows what a bad job our society has been doing in teaching tolerance, acceptance and inclusion.

 I think I just read one. 
 This one. 
 ""Wonder"" has left a very, very, VERY deep impression on me. I don't think I'd ever forget about this book and the emotions evoked in me when I read it. 
 It's THAT amazing. 
 Yes, I may read more books about zombies, apocalypses, aliens and all that stuff, but I do love my fair share of contemporary fiction. Books that make me FEEL. Books that contain drama and oscar-worthy performances of their characters. Books like ""Wonder"" here. 
 August is just like any other 10-year-old kid, except for how he looks. Due to genetic makeups and mutations, plus numerous surgeries done on his face, August doesn't look normal. But inside, he is. And he wants to be treated like he is. 
 ""Wonder"" tells the story of August and his relationship with other people, including society as a whole, in the context of dealing with his facial deformity (I think deformity is a harsh word but I can't think of any other word to substitute it right now). We get to follow August through his first-time journey at a regular school, and although the book is narrated from his perspective, the book includes viewpoints from the people around August, which just makes the story much more wholesome and complete. I'm not going to reveal whose perspectives are in the book -- because for me, I loved the surprise when I find out who's the next character I'd be immersed in. That's the joy of reading, isn't it? :) 
 Palacio has done a brilliant and incredible job creating the characters in ""Wonder"". To me, they were very realistic, and throughout the book I was constantly reminded via Palacio's smooth and amazing writing that they are just being human, and their vulnerability shows. I mean, face it, if I were August and I'm used to stares, mean words, insults and bullying, there's still a limit to how much I can take. There are going to be days when life just sucks and I'd break down. Because I'm only human. Yet in the book, August could actually poke fun at himself too, which totally makes him one awesome person. Seriously, what's there in life if you couldn't even poke fun of yourself from time to time? 
 The feelings that overcame me while reading ""Wonder"" were indescribable. I laughed, I teared up, I smiled; sometimes I felt cold and bleak at certain stuff, and others were heartwarming. It was such a wonderful mix of emotions! 
 One really great thing about this book is that I really learnt a whole lot of life lessons from it. One of which is that life is fair. I know almost all of us (including me) complain and whine about life being unfair as it is, but this book right here made me take a step back and look at the big picture, to really SEE that even if God (or the Universe if you're an atheist) didn't give you something in life that you want, He made it up to you in different ways. You'd understand better if you read the book, trust me. 
 In short, ""Wonder"" is a book about love, life, friendship, family, courage, kindness, acceptance and being human. If there's a soundtrack to ""Wonder"", it would most suitably be Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful"". Palacio even included an except of the song lyrics in the book! 
 I don't want to only recommend, but I NEED everyone out there to read ""Wonder"". And I mean everyone. I'd bet it will change your life perspectives, even if it's just a bit. 
 I'll just leave a quote that was used in the book, which I thought was an excellent one: ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."" - Dr. Wayne W. Dyer.

 He de decir que este libro constaba como alternativa si no encontraba mis otros libros en la tienda. No encontre uno, asi que acabe comprandome este. Todo un error, tuvo que ser mi plan A desde el principio 
 Lo que hace especial a este libro es el dilema moral que se nos plantea entre sus hojas. Responderme a una cosa: Cuando vais por la calle, y veis por ejemplo a, no se, una chica con pelo verde chillon. ?No la mirais aunque sea 1 segundo porque no es algo que veais todos los dias? Y ahora os pregunto, ?Y si fuera un nino con un sindrome de deformidad facial? 
 Aqui encontramos el Quid de la cuestion. Yo doy el primer paso y confieso que lo miraria. Ahora viene lo mas importante: ?Le miro porque quiero hacerle dano? ?Tirarle una piedra? ?Pegarle? No. Simplemente lo he observado un momento, no tengo la finalidad de incomodarle, de hacerle dano, pero lo hago. Y es que, muchas veces hacemos dano sin querer hacerlo. 
 Esa es la frase que mas me ha marcado del libro. Me ha ayudado a darle el valor que se merece. No puedo odiar absolutamente a ningun personaje de esta obra, a ninguno. Me he puesto en el punto de vista de Jack, de Via, de Justin, y de todos los que pueblan la novela. Todos queremos que el mundo sea de luz y color, pero no lo es, la vida es dura, buena y mala a partes iguales, y tenemos que convivir con ello. 
 He llegado a comprender el agobio de Jack, la soledad en cierta parte de Via, el rechazo de las personas, y por supuesto el dolor de August. Y es que, no culpo a ninguno. 
 Es una novela que pondria en cada aula de cada centro de ensenanza. Una novela de sabor agridulce, ni feliz, ni triste. Y eso es algo que se debe aprender de la vida, que es agridulce 
 Os lo recomiendo a todos y cada uno de vosotros.","Wed Oct 12 08:55:09 -0700 2016","Thu Jan 12 03:57:51 -0800 2017","Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2017",3,2,""

WONDER, now a #1 New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. ""

I can only hope that when Michael was the new kid in 1st grade that it went okay with him. He never talked about having any issues, but that doesn't mean that things didn't happen that he really didn't want his dad or I to know about. Connor wasn't the new kid because he started Kindergarten with the other kids. 
 I originally bought this book so Michael and I could read it together, and then when I told him about it, he said that his 5th grade class is currently reading it and once they're finished with it, they will get to go watch the movie together. I purchased it Sunday, started it Monday morning [had to finish previous books I was reading] and I finished it this morning. Definitely not one of my fastest reads, and that is okay. I really wanted to savor the story so I tried to read it as slowly as I possibly could! 
 Everytime Isabel spoke in the book, knowing that Julia Roberts is going to be playing her in the movie, I could imagine her speaking. Same with the dad, I read his parts as Owen Wilson's voice! 
 I think the book brings a good message with it. Be kind. Not everyone is going to look like everyone else expects to be normal. And I think people shouldn't pick on those who they don't think are normal looking. I did enjoy getting to read other people's views on Auggie and what they had to endure as well. Summer, Jack, Via and Justin told their stories and I did enjoy that. 
 I think this should be a book that is required to be read in 5th grade, because face it, that's when popularity primarily becomes a thing and kids get mean. They start picking on other kids around that time frame (I'm not saying 5th grade specifically).","Tue Sep 12 06:11:37 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 14 08:33:47 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 14 08:33:47 -0700 2017","Tue Sep 12 06:11:38 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 Imagining that the author does not go for the tear jerker depressing but life affirming ending, and you could probably figure the rest out. Really. Wonder only offered a few surprises. (Note, I don't think these are spoilers, but if you like even minor surprises to be surprises, don't read any further.) 
 -About forty pages in, the novel changes narrative but tells some overlapping stories in time. This saved so much about this book for me. The narration style of August alone was very accurately juvenile, and though that is an accomplishment, does not always make for the most engaging reading. Besides, because of the circumstances his character faces, he has no choice but to be an unreliable narrator. It was nice to compare perspectives on collective experiences. In addition, when the focus of the novel relies so heavily on the impact of one character's situation, it is almost a relief to be reminded that even something so personal as August's syndrome can have a huge impact on the lives of others. It also serves to remind the reader that everyone on varying degrees struggles with identity and acceptance, and thus could benefit tremendously from a kindness that is ""more than is necessary."" 
 -The book brings about a variety of unique elements to its otherwise commonplace tropes and motifs. Little things like the dad and Auggie listening to the Magnetic Fields made me smile. The teacher's treatment of the ""precepts"" for the month were neat. 
 But otherwise...well nothing was wrong, it just was not too memorable in the end. I recommend it, but I can't bring myself to rave about it.

This heartfelt but not corny story of ""fitting in"" and how to be kind is told in a unique way. There are eight sections, each told from a different character's point of view (Auggie tells three sections). Readers will relate to the bullying incidents in the plot, but the telling is what makes this stand out. I really appreciated that the adults were not just stereotypes but well-rounds characters - both parents and teachers. And a lot of the students act inappropriately, especially at first, but many but not all come around to the fact that the way one acts toward another is more about you than that other person.","Sat Jun 30 10:07:01 -0700 2012","Sat Jun 30 10:11:48 -0700 2012","Sat Jun 30 10:11:48 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

Homeschooled his whole life, his parents finally make the decision to send Auggie to 5th grade in the local public school. What follows is an incredible story of family, friendship, and the triumph of humanity and kindness. 
 Every now and then, a book moves me. Wonder is that kind of book - the kind where you run into other parents in the school yard, you chat with your children's teachers, you call up your friends and family with kids and say: YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK. Everyone should read this book. No, wait... every middle grade school should read this book. It should be part of middle grade curriculum. No, everyone should read this book. There's a lesson here for everyone. 
 Auggie is one of the most endearing main characters I have run across in a very long time. As he is introduced, we do not know exactly what is wrong with Auggie or why. This is what the author does so well, in revealing his disfigurement, providing only small glimpses so that we get to know the real Auggie before we can only see him as horribly disfigured. Of course, we have that luxury as readers, but those who would encounter Auggie in person would see his disfigurement right away; thus, as readers, we have a very different experience in getting to know Auggie. 
 Based on what we know about bullying in schools, we would anticipate that a child like Auggie would be a magnet to being abused, mocked, or excluded. This DOES happen, but what is so beautiful is that there are many other children who look past Auggie's ""face"" and see what a ""wonder""-ful person he is on the inside - something we see as readers all along. Additionally, these children go a step further to stand up to the bully and choose their own path. This is so well done! 
 And then there is Mr. Browne, the English teacher, and his precepts. Each month the children are giving a precept (i.e., ""motto"", ""quote"", etc.) to ponder and write an essay about. While there are many noteworthy ones I can highlight, it is the first that is the most poignant: 
 ""WHEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING RIGHT OR BEING KIND, CHOOSE KIND"" 
 I just about had a heart attack when I read that! I have been living by those EXACT words for 20 years after I first encountered a similar quote in the 1950's movie Harvey starring Jimmy Stewart (by the way, there are many, many fabulous quotes in that movie). This is the quote from the movie: 
 ""Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, 'In this world, Elwood, you must be' - she always called me Elwood - 'In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.' Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me. 
 Same idea right?! So, although there are other equally relevant precepts, this is the one that will stay with the reader because it is so simple: We can choose kind. As I was reading through the book, I was thinking to myself, ""This is not going to end well."" I was oh-so-wrong and I can say that at the end, tears streaming down my face I felt HOPE that if just given the words, given the options, children CAN choose kind. 
 I honestly can't rave enough about this book. 
 One note however ... my 10 year-old daughter read this book as well. She did enjoy it, but I really sensed that it underwhelmed her. I think that at her age, there is an expectation that a book is purely entertaining. That is, books should be filled with fantasy, magic, adventure, alternate realities, and so on. This is not THAT kind of book. This is REAL. This is a book that elicits 101 great discussions and that is why I think it she wasn't over-the-moon about it the same way I was. I still think it should be required reading in school.","Tue Mar 05 10:10:58 -0800 2013","Tue Jun 04 10:25:08 -0700 2013","Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",3,1,"False"

All his life he's had to deal with people staring - now it will be a whole schoolfull. 
 Told from Auggie's own voice, his sister and new friends, Wonder takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of discovery and growth.

 It's about a boy named August who is treated like a zombie/freak because of the way he looks. He looks different and people treat him differently but he knows he's just an ordinary kid. I believe the author had the right amount of humour in it and was definitely succesful in touching our hearts. Along with showing the dark side the- bullies he also showed the much greater brighter side of the world-the kind ones. I'd end this review with the words that broke my heart the most:

 My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. 
 August (Auggie) Pullman was born with many craniofacial anomalies. This causes him to be anxious to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep. A month before school, the principal invites Auggie to take a special tour of the school and meet a few of the kids who will be his class. What will ensue, is a journey through 5th, of determining who is truly kind, or uses it as a facade to make them look better. Normally, books do not get to me emotionally, but this one did.

 August Pullman was born looking...different from everybody else. His eyes are about an inch below where they should be, he has ""cauliflower ears,"" and people often ask him if he was burned in a fire. Aside from outer appearance, Auggie is just like everybody else, but not many people look past his face to realize that. This becomes apparent when, after being homeschooled his entire life, he decides to go to a regular school in the fifth grade. This story goes through Auggie's school year and the trials and transformations that come with it. 
 Not only is August a lovable, memorable character, but every single character also has a well-developed backstory that takes you into their lives. I felt like I knew everyone in August's class, and because of that I was attached to them all and I hoped so strongly for a happy ending for each of them. 
 This story also taught valuable lessons that resonate to audiences of all ages. The messages of kindness and acceptance were present throughout the book, even being included in the Dean's graduation speech. This book made me want to go out and do something nice for someone else, and I closed this book with a genuine smile on my face. 
 Also, real quick, I just want to say that there was a reference in this book to almost everything I love. There was Green Day, Beauty and the Beast, Star Wars, the Beatles...there's something for everyone. There is not one person out there that I think could hate this book, and it is worth all the hype it has received.

I think I enjoyed the parts from the other characters' POV (especially Via's - that might have been the best part, and I felt for her) much more than those from the POV of Auggie, at least the first part narrated by Auggie - I didn't buy it; it just didn't sound like something that would come from a 10-year-old. It got better and more interesting as it progressed, the novel does lay down the rules of relationships and human interaction very well, it shows that people are egocentric (sorry, August), they can be mean (hi, Julian), but they can also be incredibly kind and sweet (yes, Summer and Jack, I'm talking about you), so it had its moments. 
 I would definitely encourage my kid to read it if I had one because it has a strong moral in it, two, even - don't be mean to those who are different from you and have the courage to do your thing. Me, I think I'll have forgotten about this book by tomorrow.

 So begins the tale of August, a boy with a facial deformity about leave the safety of homeschooling to start fifth grade at an actual school. We get some insights to his appearance anyway and quasimodo comes to mind. It's the focus of the entire book. 
 The book is about August and his challenges, but it changes narrators to the people around him, and still it's mostly about him. And because it's a children's book, it works. Had it been a grown up book, I would have had many issues about this. 
 August talks about feeling completely normal, but we never get to see that. I didn't once let go of the ""problem"" with August and see him as a normal boy, because I was constantly reminded that he was different. 
 It would have been nice to read some stories of August and everyone around him completely forgetting about his deformity. For isn't it so that if you live with something long enough you stop noticing it? 
 I felt like August wasn't allowed to be ""normal"" even by his own family, he was always treated differently. And while I don't have too much experience on the matter, I would hope that people with challenges aren't constantly reminded of their limitations. 
 But again, it's a children's book. And children have different focal points than adults so maybe this works better for the younger audience. Maybe it teaches them something, and I really hope it does. For around the core of the struggle in a nice circle are the people that care for and take care of August. I hope they learn to have compassion for others. For in the changing of the narrative, we see that everybody has their own struggle, no matter who they are. And that is something we should all keep in mind. 
 But of course it holds the fairytale happy ending where the ""good"" people get their reward and the ""bad"" people get their punishment. It's written for the young ones after all.","Mon Aug 28 04:39:44 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 01 14:21:24 -0700 2017","Fri Sep 01 14:25:30 -0700 2017","Mon Aug 28 04:39:45 -0700 2017",2,0,""

 Wonder is a story about family, friendship, love, growing up and many other wonderful things. And we discover all this feelings through August, a 10 year old boy who was born with a very rare birth defect that affects the way his face looks, in the book and through different narratives we start to make a mental image of what August face looks like but let me be clear, this is not the most important thing about the book. 
 We first enter August life when he's about to start going to school for the first time (he was homeschooled by his mother). It's really interesting reading about August's first wxperiences at school, while reading I was reminded of my first days at school, and it's true what it says in the book, everyone is nervous/excited on their first day but for August it wasn't only his first day in 5th grade, it was his first day surrounded by other kids, who talk, stare and sadly avoid him. 
 As I said before Wonder is narrated by different characters all of them young, in the second part of the book we hear from Via, August sister where I think R.J. did an amazing job capturing the dichotomy of her feeling towards August, one part wants to protect him, to be there for him, to be quite about her own problems because she thinks that they aren't important compare to August's, to pretend she doesn't care that her parents don't pay the same amount of attention to her as they pay August. But another part wants his parents to pay attention to her, to ask about her day, her worries, how she feels. She wants to talk about her bad day but she doesn't because how can her bad days ever compare to one of August's bad days? 
 My favorite parts of the book are the ones that are narrated by August's friends, for instance his friend Summer says: 
 ""He's just a kid. The weirdest - looking kid I've ever seen, yes. But just a kid."" 
 Or his friend Jack: 
 ""I think the bravest thing I ever did was become friends with August"" 
 As someone who has worked with kids with different educational needs (not August's case) I can relate a lot to this book especially with this quote: 
 ""What's cool about really little kids is that they don't say stuff to try to hurt your feelings, even though sometimes they do say stuff that hurts your feelings. But they don't actually know what they're saying. Big kids, though: they know what they're saying."" 
 Because that's something that I've always said, kids can be cruel, very cruel to other kids and even adults but I do not think that kids are born that way, there comes an age in which what a kid does or says reflects on who his parents are and on how he lives his life at home. 
 Wonder is an amazing book and R.J. Palacio an amazing writer, she was able to capture so many important things in a book that ones you are reading it seems so short. The book is full of life lessons that I think we can all benefit from and I strongly believe this book should be and must be read by everyone.

It's a tale of empathy and kindness that cuts through the space between people, and I loved it wholeheartedly. 
 ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" 
 August is 10 years old, and due to a combination of rare conditions was born with a facial deformity. He's never been to school before, and the novel begins with the prospect of him starting the 5th grade at a local school. He experiences all the usual struggles of a 10 year old, like making friends, dealing with bullying, and navigating relationships with his sister and parents, but they are all magnified through the lens of looking different. 
 ""She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can't change my face"" 
 My favourite thing about Wonder is that it doesn't diminish the challenges of looking different, it doesn't sugar-coat the direct and indirect cruelty people like August experience every day. And yet it is not a sad book, it is ultimately uplifting. It draws together so many themes of friendship and love with gentle care, making it an important read for all ages. 
 ""August is the Sun. Me and Mom and Dad are planets orbiting the Sun."" 
 Wonder also includes some terrific adult characters. Though they don't get their own chapters, August's parents are very much present within this novel, something that so many YA novels lack. They are real people, with their own lives and history, their own pain and flaws, and they exist beyond the orbit of August's perspective. I think this is so important for young readers, to see examples of positive relationships with parents. They are not a perfect happy family with no struggles, but they do try and communicate, which I think gives this book much of its warmth. 
 ""so I gave her my wing to hide under"" 
 When the perspective first shifted away from August to his sister Via I was a bit thrown. I didn't expect it to be a multiple perspective novel. Once I got over that, and back into the rhythm of the story I was glad for it. August is, as Via said, the Sun around which this book orbits, but all the other perspectives add layers to his story rather than taking away from it. The end result is a story with surprisingly rich characters for just over 300 pages. 
 ""You don't need your eyes to love... You just feel it inside you."" 
 Wonder is a story about love, and I loved it right back. It reminds me of the sensitivity and heartbreaking hope of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time has, but Wonder infuses that with a gentle kindness that will warm even the coldest heart.

 There are a few things I loved about this book. 
 The first I noticed was how real the conversations felt. The author was able to very clearly represent the moods and feelings of those talking by including little stumbles and patterns that I'd associate with such conversations. 
 The second were the emotions. This book tackles a difficult subject that's bound to incite emotions in its readers when done right, and it was done right. 
 Finally, I loved the 2014 added section at the end from the antagonist's perspective. A quotation I fee says a lot from that section was: ""Don't take me so seriously! I'm not being mean. I'm just being funny!"".","Fri Aug 18 13:12:06 -0700 2017","Mon Aug 21 16:13:40 -0700 2017","Mon Aug 21 16:13:40 -0700 2017","Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Do you stare? Do you look away? Do you glance away and then look back, pretending that everything is ""normal"" and you're not bothered? Do you tease and mock? Do you cringe? Do you feel badly that you're looking at that person differently? We all do it. When we're confronted with a person's appearance that is less-than-average, we panic. We don't know what to do. We don't know how to approach that person because we can only assume that their less-than-average appearance makes them a less-than-average kind of person that needs to be treated differently. It's a twisted part of our human nature. 
 August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity, though that's an understatement of grand proportions. He's looked at differently every day. People treat him like a porcelain doll. People even scream, when startled by his appearance. He says he's used to it, but can anyone ever really be used to that sort of treatment? 
 Up until the fifth grade he's been kept out of school. His mother has homeschooled him because of the multitude of surgeries that he goes through to make his face more functional, firstly, and slightly more average, secondly. For the fifth grade, he gets sent to Beecher Prep, a private school in the city. 
 Remember what it's like being the new kid in a new school? Remember how you looked at the new kid in your school? Remember how they were treated? Now imagine going through that every single day for a year, because every time you meet someone new, you are always considered the freak: always. 
 Wonder is a remarkable story of growth. The perspective switches between Auggie, his sister, and various other friends of the kids. The growth can be seen in all the perspectives, by all the kids. This is not only the story of how one deformed kid is grown to be accepted by his peers, but the story of how a group of kids grows to accept the strange and different in their worlds.

 The story starts off being told from the point of view from August himself, the facially disfigured boy that the book is about. It moves on to the view point of the other characters (all beautifully illustrated at the start of their section). Second up to August is his sister. I was worried at the start of this, wondering what she could have to offer the development of the story, but it isn't long until you see what hardships she equally has been through as a result of her situation. Every character to voice thereafter is equally well voiced and wonderfully well developed.

Middle school seems to start in fifth grade in New York State, so the idea is , what better time to start? A meeting is arranged with the head of the middle school, Mr. Tuchman, and in joking with his dad over the guy's name, August warms up to the idea. At the interview, it turns out that Mr. Tushman has recruited some kids to show him around. One of these, Julian, will become his nemesis, and one, Jack Will, a close friend. The fact that they were recruited does lead to some hurt feelings and surprises.

 August ""Auggie"" Pullman is an little boy in the fifth grade. He loves video games and Star Wars just like so many other boys. However, he has been home schooled until this point because he was born with facial deformities and has required extensive medical intervention. His physical appearance has caused him to be excluded and shunned in so many situations that he spent part of his childhood wearing an astronaut helmet. His favorite holiday is Halloween because he can hide behind a mask and for a short while feel like any other child - a short while when appearance does not affect how people look at him and react to him. 
 In fifth grade, Auggie joins a mainstream school. This is the story of what happens in that fifth grade year. It is Auggie's story, but what pleasantly surprised me, it is so much more than that. The first section of the book is Auggie's story. Then come sections from the perspective of those surrounding Auggie. His sister Via who loves her brother but has her owns struggles and challenges as she starts a new high school. Summer who becomes Auggie's first friend at school. Jack, another fifth grader who friends Auggie. Miranda who is Via's best friend and who has been a big part of Auggie's life. Justin who is Via's new friend. Throughout, the reader comes back to August and his story. 
 Each of the characters introduced are part of Auggie's life and are changed by their relationship with him. Each of them also faces their own struggles with growing up, feeling different, and feeling left out. As such, this story becomes so much broader because we all have experienced those feelings at times. While a reader (especially the target audience of children) may not directly relate to Auggie's situation, they may see themselves in one of the other characters. 
 I love discovering books that I enjoy as an adult and that I can share with my children. Even more, I love discovering books that can spark a conversation about life and life lessons with my children.

I heard a lot of buzz about Wonder in #mglichat and from my MG writer buddies, and the book didn't just live up to my expectations--it took me to a whole new place. And that is special. 
 R.J. Palacio brings New York to life in this simple and touching story about August--Auggie to his family and friends. Auggie is different. I won't tell you how. And in fact, Auggie doesn't tell you how, either. Instead, other characters fill in the blanks for him, offering their own unique perspectives in different acts throughout the novel. Some authors mangle this format. But not Palacio--she nails it. 
 Each act in Wonder tells us only what we need to know, and moves swiftly forward with the action. We follow Auggie on his journey into fifth grade, as he adjusts to new friendships and his family adjusts to his new role. He's a normal kid, witty and charming despite his differences.

That said, my initial impression was that this book was a well-executed morality lesson for children, with a story that was sure to keep young people engaged (even if it was entirely predictable and insubstantial for older audiences). But then I met with my book club and some of that exalted membership pointed out that a message of ""just be nice to people and the world will be a better place"" is unlikely to convert any of the bullies of the world, and furthermore might be subtly counterproductive. Spoiler alert (although not for any adult who pays attention at all to the narrative): everything works out fine for our special needs protagonist in this book, and the implication is that the goodness of people will eventually win out and help those who are different to live their lives as normally as possible. But what if that's not how it works in the real world? Wouldn't that be really discouraging to a young kid who's being ostracized, who is trying ot be as nice as possible, and who finds that it doesn't help at all? So in retrospect, I don't think the Polyanna optimism of this book is good for children at all, and thus I docked it a star.","Fri Dec 06 15:02:03 -0800 2013","Fri Dec 06 15:10:20 -0800 2013","Thu Dec 05 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",0,0,""

 What a WONDERful book! This book honestly did not disappoint. I am so happy that I finally got to read it. While this story is sad, (and I did shed a few tears while reading), it is also funny, and awe-inspiring. For me, these feelings outweighed the sad. 
 ""Shall we make a new rule of life...always try to be a little kinder than is necessary."" 
 This book has many inspiring quotes but this is one that especially stood out to me. I completely agree with it as well. If we all tried a bit harder to be kinder everyday, imagine what a brighter place the world would be. 
 On another note, I absolutely loved how Ms. Palacio told the story from many different perspectives, not just August's. Especially for Auggie's friend, Jack, I could truly see how much he grew through out the story. I love seeing character growth. It makes me feel like I am joining them on their life-changing journey. This is definitely a new favorite book for me and I highly recommend it to anyone!

 I think it's like the Cheese Touch in Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The kids in that story were afraid they'd catch the cooties if they touched the old moldy cheese on the basketball court. At Beecher Prep, I'm the old moldy cheese. (page 72) 
 For me, Halloween is the best holiday in the world. It even beats Christmas. I get to dress up in a costume. I get to wear a mask. I get to go around like every other kid with a mask and nobody thinks I look weird. Nobody takes a second look. Nobody notices me. Nobody knows me. 
 I wish every day could be Halloween. We could all wear masks all the time. Then we could walk around and get to know each other before we got to see what we looked like under the masks. (page 73) 
 This was a very quick, easy read but don't let the fact that it is targeting a younger reading audience detract you from picking this up for yourself. This book is a good opportunity for us to stop and think about how we react, respond, and treat people who are ""different"" from ourselves. 
 It's so sad that we live in a society where beauty reigns supreme and youth a close second. I really wish that when we looked at people we didn't just register their outward appearance but really could see the inner beauty and heart of a person. I'd love it if we didn't even consider how someone looks or how they're different than us and instead just viewed every person coming in contact with as a human needing love, compassion, understanding, kindness, generosity, etc. almost like each person was just a blackened silhouette that you just respond to the exact same way. 
 I really hate myself when I glance away from someone with a facial disfigurement, scar, patch, birthmark, etc. because I'm trying to not be rude--but then it's a different kind of rude to not be able to withstand looking into the face of a person as you communicate with them. I also don't want to risk staring and talking to the ""defect"". For example: I really struggle with someone who has a lazy eye--do I look at the good eye or the ""bad"" eye? I try to talk to the bridge of the nose and then I'm standing there asking myself ""why is it so much easier when someone appears 'normal'?"" And then I hate myself for even trying to classify what is ""normal"" or not! 
 So, I myself have been trying to practice not even registering what a person looks like and just acknowledging everyone with a genuine smile and greeting--and not the phony pity ones that Auggie talks about in the book. It's true we're almost trying to make up for the fact that we're pitying them for being ""different"" that we plaster on our biggest, ""fakest"" smile and are just trying to make someone feel comfortable but when they see a big, unrealistic Cheshire grin that's only gonna make them more uncomfortable and feeling like they're differences are standing out more. 
 I like that this book is thought provoking and talks about various, different character's responses--whether it be someone regrets having fled the scene as they saw him coming to avoid the awkwardness or someone bluntly asking if he was in a fire. This book covers just about every kind of person and reaction and it makes you more sensitive to hearing it from the side of the one actually enduring the ""challenge"". This book made me want to downright cry when you think of the cruelty that someone can inflict on a person. 
 I dealt with my own form of bullying in grade school through junior high for my looks. I was teased for my white hair, white eyelashes, pale skin, pug nose, horse teeth, chicken legs, my clothes, wearing the same backpack two years in a row, growing up in a trailer park, the way my bangs were cut, for still playing with Barbies in 3rd grade (haha but joke's on them...I secretly played until 14). Anyway, kids will find all kinds of reasons to be a bully to someone they feel is beneath them and sometimes it is because their home life is not so good...or they're being bullied. I did survive and it made me a defender of the under dogs when I got to high school and I had my ""glow-up"" (as my niece told me it's called) and I used my positive attention from people for good. I remember one day I was walking with a girl, my senior year, and a couple of other girls approached just as I branched off from my friend and they said something along the lines of ""You're new here and all...so we feel obligated to tell you that hanging out with that ""scrubby"" girl will ruin your reputation"" and I said, ""What reputation?"" and just walked off and she and I are still connected to this day. She's such a sweet soul and I don't understand how people select friends just based on shallow standards. She was one of the first people to befriend me when I was new there. I only wanted a reputation of befriending everyone equally and I was fine if my reputation was that I was not like the likes of those ""mean girls"".

 It made me cry, which not a lot of books do, so there's that. The narrative is interesting and I finished it quickly. At first I wasn't so sure about it because I didn't like Auggie as a narrator in the beginning (the immature language etc.). But as the narrators continued tochange, I got more into it and felt it was an interesting way to let the plot unfold(and Auggie's voice grew on me as he grew up as well). 
 I'd recommend it to YA librarians and middle school teachers for sure. It's also a good, quick read for those of us who enjoy YA.

 I can't believe I waited so long to finish this book. The storytelling is so well paced. The characters are developed so well. And over anyone's life time we have all met a Julian. And while we may not have met anyone who looks like Auggie, we have met someone with his soul. If we don't realize it l, we all wish we could be like Auggie. 
 Middle school is hard enough, but to have a major facial deformity makes a tough situation just a bit harder. Oddly enough the main character Auggie doesn't grow like you'd see in your average juvenile fiction. He grows as a person. He overcomes MAJOR obstinate like the Plague game and the war. But everyone else grows so much more. 
 His parents by letting him finally go to school. Summer by throwing caution to the wind and sitting down with him at his first lunch. Jack who started to hang with Auggie, but then fell to peer pressure to bad mouth him only to come around and be a true friend. Via who wants to hide be brother for some freedom and her former best friend who claims Auggie as a status symbol. 
 Even the teachers who don't act overly protective when the war kicks up, but shows great restraint in not kicking Jack Will out after a fight. 
 This book could take the Newbery this year. I would support that 100%.

 The multi-viewed story gives everyone's perspective on the same parts of the story. Only the reader truly gets the whole story. The message, subtle through most of the book, is clearly beaten into the readers's mind during the last pages. It's a message that shouldn't have to be beaten into anyone's head, but many people need to have it beaten in their thick skulls.

The objective of such stories is to explore how kids face issues. Generally books do this by killling off the parents or having them absent for some reason. The protagonist can't tell the parents some things. What I love about this book is that it shows supportive parents instead. It still accomplishes what a YA book must, which is to challenge a child into independence by facing up to challenge on their own. In this case the challenge was going to school for the first time in Augie's life. He'd always been homeschooled previously due to medical issues but now, he was on his own and in middle school. The author did a brilliant job of building story from multiple perspectives and creating organic problems without saving the MC through deux ex machina. Instead, the entire story is believable, real and also KIND. The problems are real and hard to face and there is a pervasive answer of kindness and relation to our fellow human throughout.

 After reading this book, I curled into a ball, wiped my tears and made some hot chocolate. After I finish a good book, I always get a surreal feeling. My heart goes all like, ""wow it's actually over"" , and Wonder definitely gave me that feeling. This is one of those books that makes you feel warm, angry and fuzzy all at once! So many feels, be ready to transport back to your childhood. 
 I was skeptical about reading this book because it's geared towards children. However, after reading it, I can honestly say I would recommend this book to readers of all ages. At the time I read this book, I was in a complicated relationship with reading. My hectic life as a college student gave me no time to read for pleasure (although this could also be due to my poor time management); however, the simplicity, funny and witty nature of this book helped rekindle my love for reading again. 
 Like many others have stated, what makes this book special is the characters. The book is split into different points of views, which enables us to understand how the main character's facial deformity impacts the people around him. The story also touches on a lot of issues that kids around Auggie's age experience. The author talks about bullying, self-esteem, pet death, isolation and relationships. But it does so in a way that's relatable and sensitive. 
 I think the main message of this book is obviously subject to interpretation. But to me, the story aims to teach readers about being more compassionate and understanding. I know this might seem cliche, but you have to remember this book is aimed towards a younger audience. It's not trying to be an adult book, even though it can be enjoyed by older readers. 
 August (aka Auggie) is an innocent, witty and kind-hearted boy who is just about to start middle school. He loves Star Wars, Halloween and chocolate milk with extra foam. He is, in every way, an ordinary kid. However, what makes him unique is his face. The way he talks about his condition made my heart melt: 
 ""My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" - August Pullman 
 There were moments in this book where I cried and laughed. But ultimately, this book left me feeling grateful. I loved how intelligent all the characters were. I loved the style of writing too. If you enjoy contemporary and witty novels, then this is definitely a must-read!","Mon Mar 27 12:30:27 -0700 2017","Sun Jul 23 21:44:41 -0700 2017","Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,"False"

 This is recommended to ALL 
 I can gush about how much I love LOVE LOVE this book ,but it's too unrealistic. 
 Average looking people with minor defects such as a face full of pimples are laughed at, mocked at etc, now imagine a facial deformed person ... sure he'll be teased, bullied, look down, isolated BUT this is a weird society we are now living in. 
 People feel more sympathetic towards people with obvious defects--eg loss of limbs but NOT normal defects like acne, little hair, bad skin,weight or those unseen defects such as people who has low IQ but not so low till it's so obvious . 
 It's something like because she/he has cleft lip and pallet you must give her more attention, logically it sounds fair to that poor boy/girl because she/he's born without this or that,but what about the others like Via? 
 My favourite in this book isn't August (no offense), but it's Via, next is Jack. 
 Via reflects how I felt personally because I have a sister who was born cleft palette, it's tiring to always be sidelined yet knowing you are doing the right understanding actions . She's resilient and brave and loving,she isn't mean to be feeling human... wanting a normal life for a moment and have the attention to herself! 
 As for Jack, he has just shown us we submit to the fear of peer pressure and fear of being out of the norm,everyone wants to fit in and we will hurt people we never want or thought or even intended to hurt, yet we are good kind hearted ,we just need the courage. Honestly I felt Jack should have gotten an honor roll too,so does Summer! 
 Summer is the rare kind of friend and person you can ever find,but someone as brave as she.... that's nearly nil in our current evil pervert society. 
 Basically the book is just too good to be true, you can't have perfect loving parents,siblings, relatives,friends and teachers . Yes there are mean jerks out there,but in truth, reality is much more cruel than the mean characters Ms R.J. Palacio has portrayed which just makes me feel deflated.... sorry I'm pessimistic but I'm a realist at heart.","Fri Aug 23 02:32:34 -0700 2013","Thu Sep 05 03:39:29 -0700 2013","Fri Aug 23 08:33:39 -0700 2013","Fri Aug 23 00:00:00 -0700 2013",2,0,"False"

 I loved Auggie from the very first page and as a special needs mom, this novel pulled so many sensitive strings. I laughed, cried, got angry, I wanted to jump into this book and hug Auggie and yell at some of those kids! So many emotions in just two days!!! 
 The story is told in different characters' perspectives, which was good because I got dissapointed in one of his friends, but then you read his side of the story and I was like... ""Ok, I forgive you."" 
 However I would've loved to read from his mom's and his teachers' POV. And I didn't like the fact that Justin's perspective (his sister's boyfriend), is told in a very infromal format; no capital letters, no punctuation marks at all. He is a high school student after all.

 It was one of the first enthusiastic recommendations I've gotten at my job as a bookseller, so I took it to heart. I bought it almost immediately after this interaction, and then sat on it for a while. I needed a palate cleanser after Kangaroo Notebook, and this was the perfect prescription. 
 I was expecting this book to be maudlin and cheesy and make me uncomfortable. But really, it does a brilliant job showing that August Pullman is just a kid, and keeps the other characters grounded. One of my favorite parts was the very end. August gets an award during his fifth grade graduation. He's happy, but admits that he knows that he's getting that award because of his face, and the fact that no one wants to be him. It was so raw and honest and was such a unique example of how a well-loved kid would handle being looked at that way. 
 Let's talk about his parents, though, because weren't they a bit too perfect? They were a bit too idealized for me. I get why we couldn't get their perspective in a kids' book, but they could have seemed a tiny bit less saintly.","Thu Apr 20 21:14:50 -0700 2017","Thu May 25 21:06:47 -0700 2017","Sun May 21 10:06:29 -0700 2017","Fri May 19 23:27:23 -0700 2017",0,0,"True"

 --Olivia Pullman [August's sister], A Tour Of The Galaxy 
 I am in love with this book. Originally got it for my little sister, a shy fourth grader who's been home-schooled since forever (and we want to send her to a real school once she gets to the fifth grade, kind of like August's sitch in the book), but I couldn't help but read it first. Lately, the books I've been reading have followed this trend of disappointing me, and I'm glad to say this one didn't. It wasn't the sobfest, pity-me novel I expected, though I shed a tear or two in between chapters. It was actually pretty funny. I got a few stares from my sister when she saw me laughing by myself, book in hand. You'd think this would be a serious novel all about morality and judgment and stuff, but its not just that. It's a humorous, sincere, heartwarming, beautiful story about a kid who's just trying to get by. Remember your first day of middle school? Remember having to claw your way out of it as your mom tried to drag you out of the car and almost literally threw you inside the building? Okay, maybe that was just my experience. But I bet you were nervous too, right? Just think of how this kid felt. The book says he looks like his face had been melted, but ""whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse"". 
 The thing is, he's just like everyone else, but everyone else doesn't know that. 
 I loved August's humor and personality. I loved his Star Wars obsession and how the author used a ton of Star Wars references throughout the whole thing. I love how sobby chapters could send you falling off your seat laughing in the end. I loved how every part of it was so sincere. It almost felt like this was non-fiction. And plus points to Palacio for including other characters' first-person narratives, I mean, I love August, but getting into someone else's head that long kinda bores you. So then you'll need some other head to invade. I love how its not all about the main character. I love how, sometimes, August is not the main character at all. Other people have lives too, yknow. And having someone-- different --as a relative or a friend isn't exactly easy, either. 
 I think the author could write full books about the other characters, too. I'd love to get inside their heads a bit more. Like Justin, Miranda, Jack... They're interesting characters. 
 I'd recommend it to anyone between the ages of 8 and 80. Or anyone who's ever felt mistreated. Or anyone who knows what it's like to feel. It's beautiful. Read it.

(Although, I tend to like books as told from the perspectives of young and naive voices, a la ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime"" and ""Room"", so it was not shocking that I enjoyed this as well.) 
 I appreciated that the author incorporated several perspectives, as opposed to just August's, because August's voice tended to grate on my nerves after a bit. It was nice to break the monotony, and the voices were all unique and different. On that note, however, I did have one main problem with this book. Time and time again, we are reminded that August is brilliant and much smarter than many people his own age. It didn't read this way when he spoke. He often speaks in an extremely immature voice, saying things that do not come across as ""gifted"". Instead, he occasionally tends to come across as ""special needs"", which is the opposite of what I (and I assume the author) wanted. This is exemplified by the fact that the other 5th grade classmate's narratives just sound so much more mature and well-spoken. I do love all the characters, including August. Via was my favorite character. She was so multi-dimensional, and I feel like her perspective on life was much needed and approachable. The family dynamics, relationships, and friendships depicted in the book were all believable. Some were sweet, some were strained, some were complex, and all were believable. 
 I recommend this.","Fri Mar 21 20:52:49 -0700 2014","Mon Mar 24 11:27:38 -0700 2014","Mon Mar 24 11:27:38 -0700 2014","Sun Mar 23 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 The book's main story features Auggie. A boy born with severe disfigurement. He has been home schooled for the majority of his life but he is starting school and the book is told through the course of the school year. 
 The book is split into different sections giving the reader a chance to see how Auggie's story is through another character's eyes. I love this idea and am really impressed how quickly the pace and feel changes in the story. 
 Towards the end as there is a major development with one of the main characters I really started to get a sinister feeling. Was Auggie's life at danger? I was so scared that after growing to love a character as much as I loved Auggie we were going to loose him. The ending will definitely have you reaching for the tissues but for a sad reason or a happy one you will have to read and find out!

 I wasn't in love - I cried at one super poignant scene, but aside from that, I had a really hard time connecting. I just don't think the author made fifth graders sound like fifth graders - even if some are smarty pants homeschooled kids overcoming incredible odds. If they were 7th graders, maybe, but most of the time, the conversations between the main character and his friend Summer were more like what I'd expect from 10th graders. And the attempts to make it sound younger by using a few key vocab words or Things Boys Like like Star Wars, it just felt off. 
 Now, the parts with teenagers SOUNDED like teenagers, and I liked those much better, but since they were ancillary characters in this Very Important Book that will probably become a required reading book, it didn't do enough to warrant a higher rating. 
 I do think it's a good story to tell, of course. I'm not heartless. I must admit that I wanted to SEE August, which makes me feel like some sort of weirdo, but I was too distracted wondering what he looked like to enjoy the book. I did give a copy to my SIL who works in Special Education (though it's not about Special Ed, ok?) because I think it's a good book for educators to read.

 First time schooling was definitely experienced by everyone, we all had to go through it. We all got stared at (probably) for being the new kid in school. But in Auggie's case, it was a lot worse. He was an ordinary kid, being born with severe craniofacial anomalies, causing him to experience the ""stare"" a lot. And he had to undergo this in his new school, aside from all the other things he needed to learn and experience the first time (rules, quizes, projects, school events, friendship by choice, bullies, boy wars.. the list goes on). 
 Wonder was simply wonderfully written in a way that readers of all ages would definitely enjoyed it, and leave them in a rollercoaster of emotions (cried, laughed, angered... - repeat nth times). I personally loved the way it was told in 6 different perspectives, all in first person point of view, which includes Auggie's and the people who were deeply involved with him and whose lives were greatly affected by Auggie's presence. It gives the story more depth and insights on the character's background.

 I also loved how the book was split into different points of view, so that way we could see not only the story told from a perspective other than August's, but we could also read about other people's stories. I especially liked reading about Via and Justin (who were super cute) and also loved finding out more about Jack's life.

 Auggie Pullman was born with an extreme facial deformity. Because of this he has had to be home-schooled so he could recover from numerous surgeries he has had. But this year, he is starting middle school at Beecher Prep. He worries if the other kids will accept him, if they will stare, and if he will make any friends. Auggie says, ""I wish every day could be Halloween. We could all wear masks all the time. Then we could walk around and get to know each other before we got to see what we looked like under the masks."" This is a story of courage and also of kindness.""

 *This book deserves a standing ovation* 
 There are times when a book changes you--maybe in little ways you don't even seem to notice--but changes you one way or another. But there are also times when a book makes impact to your very core and shifts a whole new dynamic in you. It sounds dramatic when you put it that way, but it is the closest thing that can describe how I feel about this Wonder (pun intended). 
 I have never read a book so humane, so honest, and so heartbreaking as this gem. I laughed, sobbed, shed silent tears and cried happy tears while reading Auggie's life through his eyes and the eyes of people who has seen him and loved him. 
 Auggie's story is not something that is supposed to make you feel good; it's real hard-knock stuff that would make you evaluate yourself and how you see the world. 
 R.J. Palacio was able to sensitively tackle the issue that is seemed to be dealt with with curious gazes and judging eyes in reality. My heart is filled with joy as human kindness, friendship, love and bravery were clearly pivotal in the development of the story. 
 August's story is more than his own as numerous others suffer the same thing he goes through day by day. I planned to read this ages ago but now that I picked it out, I realized it doesn't matter that I read it a little late and I have not recommended this to others yet. I'm just happy it changed me in a profound way I can't fully describe. 
 And my hope is that this book changes you too, and in the end, we all choose to be a little kinder than necessary.","Sun Apr 22 07:09:47 -0700 2012","Wed Jan 25 09:50:19 -0800 2017","Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 This quotation is woven throughout the story of Augie Pullman's first year at Beecher Prep. The story is fairly simple and straightforward, written for a fifth grade reading level. But this book should be required reading for all kids, and adults too. 
 Augie, who was born with facial and cranial anomalies, has been sheltered by being home-schooled. But his parents decide that it is time for Augie to go to a real school. How Augie faces the day-to-day dramas and traumas of middle school that any normal kid would face, on top of being an outcast for his appearance, is a great story.

 Yes this book deals with a boys facial deformity in an original, informative, inspiring way. But it also nails the moment of being in 5th grade, a sort of middle-elementary age that can be lost in our obsession with teen/adolescence and (these days especially), those ""pre-teen"" years. Auggie and his pals are PRE-pre-teen and the dialogue and narration actually reflects this in a very real way. As a result, we get a fully realized depiction of Auggie's challenge just before it's complicated with the issues of personal identity and love-life that are still a couple years away, so the book is one of the few that is fascinating and relevant to 10-100 year olds.

 Sara che mi rivedo in molti aspetti della vita di August, il protagonista, tra operazioni in ospedale (stesso reparto) e inconvenienti quotidiani, anche relazionali.

Sara che scorre tutto a meraviglia e si legge in un soffio, tra risate e riflessioni amare. 
 ""Wonder"" lo consiglio spassionatamente. E uno scorcio per nulla pietistico e triste sulla disabilita, ma non solo. E anche la storia di una famiglia come tante, o come tutte, che affronta le difficolta in modo vero e vicino ad ognuno di noi. Pieno di affetto e maturita, ma anche tanta consapevolezza.

 The book is told from differing viewpoints which initially caught me by surprise because the first 80 pages is strictly from the viewpoint of August (or Auggie) and then suddenly we switch to - his sister, Via, I think. And then to someone else. Which was good - just unexpected. I have read reviews that did not like some of the voices that were chosen - but I thought they all had good questions, observations, and viewpoints. If they had not been there, then some things that Ms. Palacio wanted to say would have gone unsaid, I think. 
 August is entering 5th grade. He has a severe (emphasis on the word severe) facial abnormality and he has been homeschooled up to this point but his parents think it would be a good idea for him to try school. Not public school but a smaller private school. He is understandably against this idea. At first. But after he meets a couple of the kids, he decides to give it a try. And so the book covers Auggie's first year of school. 
 The book is all about kindness and putting others before you. Also about not judging a book (or a boy, in this case) by its cover. Actually, all the kids have hangups. It's just that Auggie's is very visible and so it takes a while to uncover what is going on with his sister and the kids that befriend (or don't befriend) Auggie. 
 I would really like to hear from kids that read the book and then reviewed it or talked about it. I think it would make a great read-aloud in middle school classroom. There are so many areas that could be opened up for class discussion and class projects. 
 I would recommend it - just keep a box of Kleenex close by because a few tears may flow.","Wed Sep 12 20:36:07 -0700 2012","Wed Sep 12 20:51:54 -0700 2012","Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

Then I went to the Scholastic Warehouse Sale the second time and bought it for myself. One quote from the book trailer burned itself into my consciousness: ""You can't blend in when you were born to stand out."" Wonder is the story of August (or Auggie). He is a 10 year old boy who has been born with severe facial deformities. Because of extensive surgeries, he has been homeschooled all his life but now he will be starting 5th grade in a regular school. The book is the story of how he, his family and new friends cope with life in this new situation. How do others treat him? Will people see beyond his weird, scary face and instead see him as he really is, inside? 
 I just LOVED this book for lots of reasons. I loved how the author wrote from various points of view. You have the opportunity to get into the head of August, friends Miranda, Jack, Summer, and sister Via. Each person has a unique relationship with August and a new insight into his life. I also really loved how the author deals with the themes of acceptance, especially of people that are different than you; the value of each and every human being, regardless of ability. August is a young man of great ability but his facial deformity makes people think he is stupid, incapable of learning, of being human. The book this reminds me of Out of My Mind by Sharon Draper. From Amazon's description: ""Melody is not like most people. She cannot walk or talk, but she has a photographic memory; she can remember every detail of everything she has ever experienced. She is smarter than most of the adults who try to diagnose her and smarter than her classmates in her integrated classroom--the very same classmates who dismiss her as mentally challenged, because she cannot tell them otherwise. But Melody refuses to be defined by cerebral palsy."" This is another powerful book about the courage of those with disabilities and how we need to look beyond the outer layer of people and instead, focus on the inner person.","Sat May 19 13:49:36 -0700 2012","Sun Jun 03 15:31:25 -0700 2012","Wed May 30 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

 (Original review) 
 4.5 The simple message of this book is kindness. 
 As I sit here in my school library and listen to the stories of students whose lives are so different from my mostly picturesque childhood, I can't help but remember this story. I need to remember that I might be someone's only smile that day or only kind words. Remember that I don't know what goes on at home or what is like to be them, even if I think I do. Remember that I might be the only one who looks them in the eye or talks to them one on one. Remember that I might be the one they think of when they need to remember what kindness is. 
 If you need some examples of kindness, read Wonder. Told from various points of view, this story of a a boy who doesn't fit in and the people who surround him with kindness. These characters are not perfect but it is easy to see why they keep trying.","Tue May 14 11:01:46 -0700 2013","Wed Aug 16 08:13:28 -0700 2017","Thu May 02 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",4,1,"False"

The overall 3 rating is because parts were difficult to read like the book not all being from Auggie's point of view (think Justin's section). Part of me really gets why it was so necessary and I am really glad to better understand the individual motivations of the characters but it was hard to have so many parts and I really disliked reading Justin's part. 
 I liked the character development a lot, you felt that they were really individuals. Auggie wanted to be normal, Via wanted a taste of anonymity, Miranda wanted a family who noticed her, Jack wanted to be good and to have a genuine friend, Julian wanted popularity, etc. 
 I really liked Mr. Tushman, you can see through what he is trying to do the whole book but it is subtle and so heartfelt. I loved the message he brought through about transition points in our lives and how you shouldn't just let middle school age kids off the hook or expect them not to develop character-if not then when? I also liked the subtle message to parents throughout the book about being involved in your kids lives-you could tell the difference in the book between characters whose parents were involved (think Jack, Auggie, Summer) and those who weren't or who taught the wrong things by example (Julian). 
 Choosing kind is so important-everyone has a heart and feelings no matter what they look like, act like, etc. Since we never know what is truly going on with another person we should all do our best to be kinder and genuine about it.","Sun Feb 16 21:23:32 -0800 2014","Thu Aug 14 15:13:36 -0700 2014","Wed Aug 13 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Tue Aug 12 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

A daughter that has to grow up fast, gets sidelined ( not through bad parenting, just the facts of their lives) and she understands. All the voices ring true and I loved them all. 
 I docked 1 star for the chapter narrated by Via's boyfriend Justin. I know it was done for a reason I just don't understand what the reason is... Why on earth are there no capital letters!

But he has one very important thing that makes him different: his face. Auggie was born with a severe craniofacial deformity that even several surgeries have not been able to fix. 
 But life has been mostly OK for Auggie, because he's lived with his loving sister and parents, who homeschooled him. But then they tell Auggie something he is not prepared for: He will be going to regular school as a fifth grader. 
 I can't even tell you how much I enjoyed this book. It's so rare that a book has you feeling a gamut of so many emotions. I laughed, smiled, cried, and felt tinges in my heart for some of the things Auggie was going through. I am a mother, and I cannot imagine having to be in that situation to have a son so different. 
 The best thing about August is that he has such a great sense of humor through it all. He laughs at himself more than anyone else does. In fact, he is the one who makes others feel comfortable around him. In spite of the lot he's been given in life, once you get to know him he makes friends easily. 
 I really enjoyed the use of the different narrators throughout the book as well. It was great to get each person's different perspective on life with Auggie and see where they were coming from. The only thing I wish I could have seen was maybe a chapter from each of Auggie's parents. 
 It would have been easy to make a book about a ""deformed"" boy and overcoming adversity very sappy and eye-roll-inducing.

Palacio hits the tone of this book perfectly (maybe she still feels like a grade five student inside?) and it has the ringing endorsement of the kids at our house. 
 Her main character, August Pullman, has been home-schooled by his mother for years and his family decides he should start attending a normal school in grade five as it is the time that many kids transition to a new school and so many of them will feel awkward and 'new'. August - ""Auggie"" - isn't exactly sure that this is the way to go but agrees to give it a try. Tricky part in his life though, is that he was born with severe facial deformities and has undergone something like 27 surgeries in his short life to try and improve some of the difficulties he was born with, like problems with his palate or eyelids. 
 August goes through all of the difficulties of being an unusual new kid but it is multiplied hundreds of times over. The changes he goes through and the changes of his classmates are what make this book fascinating and R. J. Palacio's gift for looking into that 10-year old brain and emotions make it real. 
 At the end of the book August thinks ""I didn't destroy a Death Star (he is a fan of Star Wars) or anything like that, but I did just get through the fifth grade.""

This book is about a boy named Auggie who is completely normal. Oh! Except for that one thing about having a deformed face. I will not reveal too much about plot except that it's about Auggie's struggles while attending school for the first time as a 5th grader. But that's not all folks, this book also centers around other side characters by switching pov's, something I want to mention because I'm listing it as a reason you should read this book. 
 Without further ado, here's what I thought about Wonder. 
 1. Deformities: I loved how Auggie's deformities were revealed to us. It is clarified right off the bat that there's something not right with the way Auggie looks, but as you read, the picture starts to come together, and I loved that! Not just as a reader but as a writer. When you study writing in first person, you always have the conversation about how to best relate to your reader what your MC looks like, and this book was an exemplary example of that rule. But as a reader, it allowed me to delve deep into the core of Auggie's character and approach his deformities with just the right mind-sight. Well done, Palacio, well done. 
 2. About Auggie: My favorite thing about Auggie was how down-to-earth he was. There was no pretentiousness in his character. I feel that's a common approach when it comes to books like these, but Auggie was such a normal, flawed, quirky, nerdy, kind little boy, endearing and so realistic. 
 3. About Those POV's: I have to admit, I wasn't hooked on this one until a bit into the book where we started getting more pov's. I really like Auggie and his story to begin with, but what it was was that the book switched to Auggie's sister, Olivia's, perspective and I found myself relating to her so strongly it hurt. And I think that's what Palacio was trying to do overall, put something in this book for everyone. Of course, I like all the other's, and Auggie's story was the one to make me cry tears of joy in the end. I'll just go on a tangent and say it now, what a wonderful ending!!! 
 4. Bullying: The theme of bullying is a heavy one in this book, and it relates to ALL of the characters' stories. Seeing it in such a diversified and complex light was critical to this book's theme, and a big reason why I loved it so much. 
 5. Transcends the Ages: This is definitely a book that transcends the ages: Here's why. 1) Kids of this age group will have so many things they can directly relate to. 2) Teens and older teens will remember all of the emotions captured in this book with painful remembrance. Yet somehow, at the same time, it feels so good to know you are done with that time of your life and survived it. Plus it makes you analyze all the past bull-shit you went through, which can be an empowering thing, truly. 3) Adults are portrayed well in this book and I think it would be interesting for adults/parents to see the characters Palacio has chosen and how he has portrayed them. Plus it's a good reminder of how complex and difficult young adult life is at all levels. 
 6. Makes Me Think: I love it when books make me think and then subsequently catch me by surprise at my own thoughts. In this book I realized I saw Auggie's skin as being burned (likely because Auggie tells us that he has been commonly thought of as being deformed due to getting stuck in a fire). But the thing was, I knew that wasn't true from the start, so why did I see him that way? He is intensely deformed in every feature of his face, but that doesn't mean his actual skin is grotesque. I don't exactly know what this realization said of me, but I think it's something to do with seeing an unfamiliar thing or hearing an unfamiliar concept and automatically associating it with something undesirable or inferior or even gross or pitiable. When it's actually just different. 
 Hmm, what do you think?","Fri Mar 08 23:22:10 -0800 2013","Sun Jul 13 22:08:43 -0700 2014","Tue May 27 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Thu May 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 In that one sentence is wrapped the premise of Wonder: to be kinder than is necessary. That it's not enough to be kind but that one should be kinder than needed. That the decision to be kind is a choice each and every single one of us faces, but that not every one chooses to do so, because, let's face it, it's hard. 
 I don't really want to say too much about this book, only that it is simultaneously beautiful and ugly and all too real. I think each person has to discover it for themselves and take whatever meaning they want to from it, because each person is different. Each person is flawed, and those flaws -- whether real or perceived, regardless of whether they are physical, emotional or psychological -- almost always affects how we behave and are perceived by others. 
 This is an adult book that I think children should read. Many will say this was written for young adults (and I think that's probably true as well) but I believe adults would benefit from reading this anyway. It's very easy to lose sight of things when people, regardless of age, are caught up in the drudgery of their own quotidian existence. It's easy to lose sight of how lonely life can be even when you're surrounded by so many people, or how uplifting it can be when someone notices you. 
 There's much to be learned by everyone from this novel, least of which is this: we all have a choice about how we are with others -- and everyone, to a degree, is imperfect, flawed, damaged -- and that being kind or nice is not easy, even if you love someone very much. Sometimes it's easier to be cruel or mean or even neutral. That sometimes, in the need to want to belong to a group, in the desire to be accepted, it's easier to do something atrocious and demeaning just so you're not alone or ostracized. And sometimes, part of growing up is making the hard choices and not conforming, that we all need to accept and love our flaws. 
 Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world. -- Auggie

 Wonder is divided into several parts, each with a different character point of view. Auggie opens and closes the novel, getting the most ""page time"". He uses kid-friendly terms to explain how it feels to live with his deformity. For example, he says that the school secretary gives him a ""shiny smile"" when she first meets him. Shiny smile = a fake, too big, smile people use when they feel uncomfortable. 
 I especially enjoyed the POV of Auggie's older sister Via. She describes the universe of her family: Auggie is the sun, and she and her parents are the planets spinning around him. Her words aren't resentful, just terribly honest, and compelling. 
 The other voices include a few of Auggie's and Via's friends I like how Palacio portrays how Auggie's situation affects the people around him. The peripheral characters earn my empathy and attention just as much as Auggie does. 
 One of my favorite adult characters is Auggie's English teacher. (Of course, right?) Every month Mr. Browne gives his students a precept, or motto, to think about, and he opens the year with this one: 
 ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."" - Dr. Wayne Dyer. 
 Some of the BIG IDEAS Wonder addresses are straightforward: friendship, loyalty, and judging appearances. But some are more tricky. Like, is it ok to break a rule if you are protecting a friend? And, what's the difference between protecting someone and babying someone? 
 Overall, a thoughtful novel that's great for middle grade readers through adults!

Some people will not love this book like I do. This is the story of 10-year-old Auggie Pullman, a boy with severe facial abnormalities even after numerous surgeries. Auggie's face strikes fear in little kids, meanness from kids his own age, and strange looks from adults. Auggie has been home-schooled his entire life, but his parents have decided that it is time for him to go to public middle school. The story is told from multiple perspectives, and it is funny, heartwarming, sad in places, and wonderful...to me. The problem that some readers will have is that the book presents the world as it should be rather than how it really is. For example, Auggie's new principal is wonderful. He draws Auggie out of his shell, doesn't have the normal horrified reaction most adults have to seeing Auggie's face, and helps Auggie warm to the idea of attending public school. While there are many principals just like this, there are also some who would not give Auggie this kind of time and attention. For some readers, too many characters are perfect and wonderful.

 The biggest people encouraging me to bump this up on my are as follows: 
 My wife Liz, who got my daughter Eleanor to read it as well. 
 My daughter Eleanor, who asked me after I was 5 pages in, ""what's your favorite part?"" 
 Tim, a friend I teach with, who is also a goodreader. 
 *Sidenote* 
 So Tim, who I teach with, put this really cool ""book review wall"" outside his room. It was great. 
 Check it out, sorry it's a little blurry: 
 The best part was, instead of giving books stars, or thumbs up, or whatever, he rated them in Isenbargers. (Mrs. Isenbarger is our school Librarian/Media Specialist.) I thought it was really clever, and much better than the boring old stars that goodreads uses. (No offense, goodreads.) 
 At any rate, Wonder earned a high 5! ISENBARGERS!! 
 *End Sidenote* 
 The book was also recommended by our science teacher - Mrs. Shelton, several goodreaders, and praised by a cousin-in-law Seulky - and by extension her daughter - during the reading. 
 All that to say: the book didn't disappoint. To live up to all that hype is a feat in and of itself. 
 Eleanor had read it, but asked me if - since I was reading it myself - would I read it out loud to her. I told her I would when she was around, but I wouldn't read the whole thing. Man, did she love this book. Every couple pages, she'd ask me what my favorite part was up until that point. She had to cover her mouth so she wouldn't give anything away. 
 She asked if she could help me review this one, but I told her no. I wanted to review this one on my own. It was really interesting reading sections with her. She doesn't quite realize what a Wonder she is herself. 
 It was tough for me to read the part out loud to Eleanor where the mom is describing Auggie's birth to August himself. She didn't catch the nuance. She only caught the comedy and love: the farting nurse, the doctor passing out, and the love that the mother had for August. She heard the story as August himself heard it. I, on the other hand, heard the story that wasn't told. The perspective of a mom telling about a time in her life when she was very scared, and very alone - knowing that she can't tell this version to her son, which is still as much the truth as the other version. 
 The version she told Auggie was not a lie of omission. There are many ways to tell a story. That was one of the strengths of the book: the way it pulled in the different perspectives so well. 
 Yeah, it was tough reading that part out loud. But it was brilliant to hear Eleanor laughing as I read it. 
 Here is the video for the song Wonder, if you're interested. Which begs the question: was Auggie the only wonder in this book?","Mon May 30 17:32:52 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 28 17:24:51 -0700 2016","Thu Jun 02 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Mon May 30 00:00:00 -0700 2016",9,0,"False"

It was thoughtful and thought provoking, plus wonderfully written with enough humour and liveliness to make it perfect for younger readers. 
 It deals with complicated issues in such a way that it emphasises the idea that they shouldn't be 'taboo'. It encourages the reader to embrace difference and understand that difference is normal. 
 The focus was on August, who is astoundingly mature for his age - though we still understand that he is a child verging young adult. He's remarkably good-natured though his situation is tough. He overcomes it gloriously, though not without its down bits, and it's wonderful to see the glorious way he brings out the best in those around him. 
 It's told from multiple perspectives, and I felt like I got to know every character. From August's friends Jack and Summer to his sister, Olivia, and her boyfriend. I kind of adored Mr. Tushman. 
 His family is caring if not overbearing and I loved Olivia's input in the novel. She has had to deal with a lot whilst understanding her life isn't as necessarily difficult as Augusts. But she still has her own problems to deal with, from friends to thinking her mum doesn't care for her as much as August. 
 This story isn't just about August's face, it's also about children and young adults having to deal with growing up and all it contains: school, friends, and family. It's a wonderful book written by someone who put a lot of care in to representing the under-represented in novels and life.

There are sad moments and funny moments just like in life but I never felt like the author was trying to manipulate the reader into an emotional reaction. Also, there were Star Wars references which is a big plus in anything really. The story is told from several viewpoints and they have interesting or intriguing moments. August, the main character has his own sections but the ones told by Via his older sister are just as, if not more, compelling.

Written for young adults, it contains life lessons and reminders of basic truths that people of all ages can benefit from.","Sun May 26 23:26:03 -0700 2013","Sun May 26 23:52:55 -0700 2013","","",0,0,""

I've seen a couple glowing reviews for it, but I didn't think much about it until I saw it in the library last week, and I was like ""why not?"" I read the first few pages to test the book out, and I somehow ended reading thirty pages...and I still wasn't sure what's up with the main character, Auggie: from the first few pages, I knew he had something that set in apart, but I didn't know what exactly--so I borrowed the book to sate my curiosity. And boy am I glad I did. 
 Wonder is the fascinating, inspiring story of Auggie who is born with a severe Treacher-Collin's syndrome, making his face almost hideous to strangers. He attends school for the first time in fifth grade, and he struggles to fit into the school environment. But he is not the only one with problems as his friends and family also struggle to adapt to him. The story, theme may be predictable, but it's the execution that makes Wonder special. Each character has their own engaging, heartfelt story to tell. Wonder is definitely one of my favorite, thought-provoking reads this year. It opens itself to many discussions, and I wish I read it when I was in fifth grade. 
 So What Does August Look Like? 
 Admittedly I had a hard time picturing August (Auggie) since the descriptions made him sound like everything that could possibly go wrong--went wrong on his face. What in the world are cauliflower ears? And no jaw? bulging eyes? 
 So I Googled. And it was just heartbreaking. Though maybe I've seen my share of not-so-normal things, it didn't surprise me. I can see why kids would be horrified though. 
 Fifth Graders Can Be Mean: 
 What stood out for me was Palacio's uncanny ability to capture the feeling of being ostracized in school. I had a nostalgic feeling of being back in fifth grade (even if it has been nine years ago) and I had my share of unwelcome peers--and I wasn't even suffering from Treacher-Collins syndrome. Like Auggie, I've dealt with ""The Plague,"" friends who didn't stand up for me, and knowing telling the teacher is pretty useless (even if you can live down being a tattleteller.) Fifth-grade was serious business, and I was glad I missed the last week of school for a trip--I was eager to get away from my peers. 
 The thing that hurt most was the realization that the 10-year old me would probably not stand up for Auggie. Instead I would be grateful that it wasn't me that they were picking on. Not having a partner for field trips or group projects was not on my list of priorities. Hey! I was ten, stuff like that matters. 
 Characters: 
 I was pleasantly surprised with Palacio's wide spectrum of characters and how the voices still remained distinguishable. Wonder is composed with several points of view from Auggie, Jack, Summer, Via, Miranda, and even Justin. They may be all kids, but they speak volumes. I was delighted with their complexity, and I ended up loving each character for being themselves. I was disappointed I didn't get Julian (the head bully)'s viewpoint though, I was convinced he had more depth--beyond the influence of his stuck-up, rich parents. What I really wanted to see was Julian's parents being taught a lesson. 
 August (Auggie) 
 I have mixed feelings about him. Throughout the novel I see him grow-up, and not use his appearance as an excuse: when he goes to sleep by himself without being told and when he leaves his stuffed animal behind. But even at the end of the novel, I can't help feeling like he hasn't changed that much. There's a scene where he hopes that he will be handsome man in his next life, and his dependency on the astronaut helmet--both of these scenes make me feel Auggie is still the kid in the beginning of the novel. Rather, I think it's the people around him that deserve more credit. 
 However, I still admire this kid. Never did he feel sorry for himself, or wonder out of the probabilities--why was he chosen like the people around him do.) 
 Olivia (Via) 
 My favorite character, and arguably the most realistic one. August's older sister who is starting high school. She's my favorite character for she embodies so many conflicts, but yet still remain in control of her emotions. She is a wonderful older sister. Via is also a heart-wrenching character because she loves Auggie, but she hates herself for the less-than-nice thoughts she has of her brother. At times Via shows signs of sibling jealousy--but yet she restrains herself. She constantly debates what's best for her brother: if they should make him feel normal (and if that would be lying to him), or teach him how to deal with being abnormal. 
 Justin: 
 Via's boyfriend. He is the passive observer who at first doesn't know how to react to Auggie. I had my reservations since his lack of capitalization irked me, reminding me of Omegle conversations with illiterate people (I imagine him talking in slurs.) He also seemed like a very reserved character. But even he does some surprising things that made me like him instantly. 
 Summer: 
 One of Auggie's friends. Honestly, I find her the most unrealistic character. Not being she's super nice (which she is), but because her actions are idealized. Why would you sit down and immediately start making a list of names with a kid you just met? I am not sure how good of a conversation started that is in real life. 
 Ending: 
 I was bracing myself for a happy, cheesy ending--and I got the unrealistic, happy, cheesy ending I secretly didn't want. Oh well, at least it tied well to Auggie's belief that ""everyone deserves a standing ovation."" 
 Despite the cheesy ending, I fell in love with Wonder. There are points in the book I wasn't a big fan of such as the whole precept idea. I just thought that was unnecessary and even slightly lame. But I loved the multiple perspectives, and the astronaut helmet. A brilliant novel, and an inspiring story.","Fri Jul 27 02:45:29 -0700 2012","Fri Jul 27 23:24:08 -0700 2012","Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,"False"

 Augie himself was wonderful as a character, and I really liked the way his family was portrayed. Even when they did things I didn't like, they were believable and interesting. I had more trouble with his sister's friend Miranda, whose section was less convincing. The kids who were Augie's own age were very realistic, but some of the slightly older kids and teens seemed a little too cardboardy. 
 Augie's ability to get past the pain of his own life was inspiring. As a reader, I both felt sorry for him and attracted to him, because his personality came across as friendly and charismatic, which is amazing in the face of what he had to go through. I thought that his fascination with Star Wars was really cool, and found it sad that he thought he had to ""outgrow"" that aspect of his life. I mean, he made it through 5th grade in a brand new environment with all of his other challenges, but somehow having a Star Wars poster in his bedroom was going to distance people from him? That didn't quite make sense, and if it was to indicate that he was maturing in some way, it didn't work for me. 
 Augie's other interactions with people, even the negative ones, were brilliantly crafted and convincing. While Palacio gradually describes the details and deformities of Augie's face, over the course of many pages, the mind's eye has a hard time putting them together in a way that makes the reader flinch. So, by the time you realize just how different his appearance is, you've come to accept Augie. That was extremely well done.","Mon Sep 17 15:21:17 -0700 2012","Mon Sep 17 15:43:17 -0700 2012","Mon Sep 17 15:43:17 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

His eyes are low on his face. His mouth has been operated on multiple times due to a cleft palate and other problems. But Auggie's biggest problem can be summed up in two words: middle school. He's about to be entered into his first mainstream school as a 5th grader, and the reaction he gets will surprise even him. 
 This parable on looks and America is surprisingly mundane in its approach. Take away the deformity and you would be lulled with all of the typical school scenes and equally humdrum upper-middle class NY domestic scenes. But the angle of Auggie's face helps to throw the book off a fatal flaw just enough. Instead, you actually start to feel for the kid. Cynics need not apply, of course, but if you like feel-good stories, you will find yourself cheering the boy's battle against stereotypes, ignorance, and especially cruelty. 
 The book's point of view shifts from Auggie to his beautiful sister Via (Grade 9), his allies and his enemies. You might think an older sister would be blessed, dodging the ""bad genes"" as she did and being beautiful on top of it. But Via must live in the shadow of a sibling who needs constant attention and THAT becomes a cross to bear as well. Stress on the parents? Yes, that too. 
 Mostly, though, the book gets into the small-time, mud politics of the school. Dirty tricks. Shifting alliances. Expected cruelties and unexpected acts of kindness. Defeats, victories, hesitations -- all with the reader knowing full well where it's heading. In fact, if you read past page 100 it's because you've signed a virtual contract that you want to cry with joy at the end. Well, if you're the teary sort. The eye-roll sort will have bailed long ago. 
 For middle school readers, this wholesome book is a parable worth listening to. Given its message, I can only hope that the book -- set for release on Valentine's Day -- takes flight and that many fall in love with it. For me, that's the important part.

Wonder is a great middle school book about finding friends and confronting bullies. It is also a story about family and love. The main character, Auggie, is a medical wonder because of his facial ""disfigurement"" which adds an entirely new perspective to the standard middle school blues story. It's more than just about fitting in, it's about overcoming fear and embracing the good things in life.

 While some people are dying to be seen as ""normal"", others hate the sound of the word ""normal"" following their names. I don't know a clear definition myself! What I know for sure is, NOthing is normal until you believe it is. 
 Wonder; a book recommended by dearest Dana. 
 August or Auggie Doggie (as his father calls him) is a fifth grader who is not normal. He is not a child with a special need although he has some kind of syndrome that he doesn't even know how to pronounce. Something is wrong with Auggie's face. Don't bother to imagine how bad it is because ""whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse"". Because of ""this"", he's been homeschooled by his mother who's never been a real teacher. 
 The story begins when Auggie overhears his parents discussing the possibilities of transforming him to a traditional school. The idea terrifies him at first but he finally decides to give it a try. The rest of the story tells us about his experience and all the challenges and issues he and his family face after this important decision. 
 Characters take turns telling the story from their own prospectives. Palacio does a great job moving us between them. I very much enjoyed that technique. The only annoying thing was when ""Justin"" takes his turn, all the punctuation marks suddenly disappear. To me, reading that chapter was rather challenging. 
 Issues that might come-up when homeschool students transfer to traditional schools, 
 challenges of being parents or siblings of children with special needs, 
 spreading awareness among children and adults, 
 and what is considered a special need and what is not, are all topics that were brought up in the book. 
 Easy read, 
 deep and inspiring.","Sun Feb 10 19:07:42 -0800 2013","Thu Mar 07 19:53:27 -0800 2013","Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",5,0,""

 Plot: August was born with a chromosomal abnormality that affects how his face looks. This book is about him and his family as he starts in a private school after being homeschooled, and follows him throughout the year as he deals with the reactions of the kids and adults in a school situation. 
 Language: This is a middle-grade novel, so obviously not much to worry about with language. There were various uses of God's name in vain, no cuss words. 
 Sexual Content: August's older sister ""long"" kisses a boy. That's it. 
 Spiritual: There was some spiritual/philosophical stuff in this book that is probably good for parents to be aware of if their kids read it - most notably some talk about Heaven and one of August's friends theory of reincarnation (August says he likes her theory). Worth a discussion for those of us who are Christian parents. Some misapplication of quotes from the Bible (like August's ""precept"" at the end of the book). 
 Other: Some mean comments from different bullies, including one comment from a kid who said he'd ""kill himself"" if he looked like August. Later August and this boy are reconciled and laughing about how they'd ""kill themselves"" if they were so-and-so. I didn't like that. 
 Overall: I really enjoyed this book overall! The story was sweet and full of those bittersweet moments that make you choke up a bit. I liked how it gave the perspectives of different characters besides just August's too. I would just say to know your kid before you hand them this book, in case some of the bullying comments would affect them negatively (especially the comments about suicide, which were cringe-worthy to me as a parent).","Wed Jul 05 12:08:27 -0700 2017","Wed Jul 26 08:17:04 -0700 2017","Wed Jul 05 12:34:53 -0700 2017","",1,0,""

 I mean, obviously, I gave it four stars, and the main problem I had with it is that it didn't really 'click' with me - and the reason it gained 'liferuiner' status for me is because of a part in the Julian chapter. But I did really enjoy reading it. It was a lot of fun, and I liked most of the characters, and the ones I didn't I felt kind of weird about wanting to punch in the face, because they're fifth graders and that's kind of bad. Thankfully, Jack takes care of that. Good job, Jack. 
 This book follows August Pullman, a boy with a severe facial deformity that's going to school for the first time. Of course, there are problems. But there's a lot of happiness, too. It was a pretty happy book, and I enjoyed reading it. 
 The book is told from several different perspectives - there's August, of course, as well as a few of his friends or people that are observing the story and can put their point of view on it. I really did like how the story was told, and while I think that Jack's POV was possibly my favorite (I also liked Justin's, just because of how interestingly it was written, but I didn't actually care about Justin, so that kind of made it not my favorite), I did enjoy all of them. 
 This book was definitely good. And maybe I'll re-read it someday and it will click with me and then I'll decide that younger me was stupid and give it five stars instead of four stars. But for now, four it stays, because it is a good book.","Mon Oct 27 16:43:33 -0700 2014","Mon Nov 03 04:42:43 -0800 2014","Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sat Nov 01 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,"True"

I actually started reading this with a group of children at school and then I made sure we all had a copy so we could all finish it over the holidays. The short chapters, the mystery behind what August really looks like, the situation with him and his school had us all completely mesmerised and desperate to carry on reading it. 
 Firstly, I loved the character development in this book. It's not just August who grows and learns over the course of the novel. This book is written from several points of view and all the other characters grow and change and I love that about the story. The point of view who we don't hear from is the one belonging to any adult. There are no teacher chapters or parent chapters, this is told entirely from the children's perspective, which I think is brave but brilliant! I particularly enjoyed seeing august's sister Via change over the course of the novel, the kids I was reading with agreed that intiallly she seems passive aggressive but that we do feel sorry for her having to deal with all she deals with, she really blossoms in this novel and the way she deals with her own problems in truly admirable! 
 I loved the idea that whatever August has is an entirely new thing, it means that no one has the exact condition he has and so there's no risk of offending people with one of the conditions he has because he is completely unique, and indeed the novel teaches that it is completely ok to be unique, this is strong message throughout the whole book. I loved August sense of humour as well, we know that he sees himself as normal and why should no one else, but we see that he copes with the way he looks and the way he is different from everyone else with humour and courage and yet he can completely empathise with others, despite his being so completely unique! 
 There are some very funny bits in this novel, it's not all moral lessons, there is a storyline and humour, action which will leave you breathless, and real life. Anyone starting a new school or a new situation will be able to identify with August and his fears, Via too! This also teaches a powerful lesson about friendship and bullying which is why I decided to read it at school, it is beautifully written too which also comes in handy at school but which adds to the fact that this book is completely addictive.

I know that this is something I will want to reread again and again!","Tue May 27 07:45:51 -0700 2014","Fri May 30 05:48:00 -0700 2014","Fri May 30 05:48:00 -0700 2014","Tue May 27 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

But mostly, Wonder is a book about courage. The courage August needs to put a smile on his disfigured face everyday. The courage his friends show in loving and protecting August despite their own ambitions. 
 Wonder is a middle grade novel, written specifically with middle school children in mind, but the lessons learned are valuable for all ages. Written from the alternating points of view of six adolescent children, Palacio takes her readers through August's first year of real school. Until the fifth grade, because of the number of surgeries necessary to repair his cleft palette and facial disfigurements, August had been homeschooled by his mother. These alternating points of view add depth and insight into the plot. While none of the secondary points of view are well developed, these voices are effective in validating Auggie's character. 
 At the beginning of every month, Auggie's English teacher writes a precept on the blackboard, a rule to live by, for the children to contemplate before writing their response. The precepts I appreciated the most were the ones the students sent in to their teacher during the following summer. 
 If your mother is anything like mine, she harped on you constantly about the proper use of pronouns. Never put yourself first! I beat on my children about their poor grammar all the time, to no avail. My hope is, one day they will finally hear it like I hear it when someone uses a pronoun incorrectly. It grates my nerves like someone running their fingernails down a chalkboard. 
 My one beef with this novel is the improper use of pronouns. To make matters worse, the majority of the errors were made when the pronoun was the subject of the sentence. Fourteen instances, in fact, but who's counting. 
 I understand Palacio was hoping to authenticate the voices of her characters by adopting the language they speak. But as writers, we have a responsibility to set an example. To do otherwise is putting our stamp of approval on incorrect grammar.

 ""The universe was not kind to Auggie Pullman."" 
 And still he was so brave! I really liked this book. While I was reading this I just couldn't imagine a good ending. But oh boy, I was wrong. It was so beautiful and I ended up crying the last few chapters! And I really didn't expected the last sentence: It was perfect 
 I really recommend this book! It's a perfect read in between a series or whatever. Plus the chapters are short, which is so good (I could say 'one more chapter' without ending up reading an hour to finish it like in other books :D). All the characters are so well described and real. I really loved the change in POV's. 
 & This book will seriously make you think more about judging, appearances, friendship and family.

 It would be a difficult topic to cover by a lesser author...and I would argue this author just pulls it off. There is humor, Augie is a well-drawn character and the subtlety makes this community feel alive. 
 There are some choices the author made which probably made her task a bit easier, all of which can fall under the category of conflict avoidance. We get various perspectives, but not the one I really wanted...this was a choice not to have too much sympathy for a bully, which I get...but if writing is a project of explaining social variables (and I think it very much it is), ignoring the bully is dodging the project the author set out to do. This may be simply due to the audience; hence the very (almost too) happy ending. It gives us little to chew on or mull over.

It takes on big issues (bullying, dealing with differences, adolescence, personal growth, family, integrity) in a poignant, sweet, uplifting way.

Palacio is the story of August who has a radically deformed face--no ears, his eyes at cheek level, a cleft palate which has required numerous surgeries. He's smart and funny, but you can almost imagine the torture he endures from children and adults both, especially when he starts school for the first time in the fifth grade. 
 Early in the book August resists having to go to school. He says, ""I miss being a baby, not knowing stuff."" Innocence is blissful--particularly for August. 
 August tells his story, but so do others, deepening and widening the reader's understanding of August's life and the many lives he affects. Some voices are of fellow fifth graders. 
 Summer befriends August. She doesn't think he looks so scary. 
 Jack, on the request of the principal, befriends August. Jack forgets about August's odd appearance and they seem to be friends. But his painful betrayal feels true to life. 
 August's older sister, Via, 14, just starting high school, adores August. But how complicated it is to always have to make sacrifices for him. His problems are always bigger than hers and he always gets more attention from their parents. She understands this, of course, but sometimes she needs attention, too. 
 Via's ex-friend, Miranda, cherished August when they were younger, but now she's moved on to have friends other than Via, which is hard for both Via and August. 
 Via's new boyfriend sheds light on August's loving family and makes the reader see that, yes, things are rough for August, but people adore him in a way most people aren't adored. He says, ""The universe takes care of all its birds."" It's hard not to love these characters. 
 Both family and school scenes feel authentic. There's no cuteness. The author understands feelings, their subtleties, and when our behaviors surprise us, especially in adolescence. We don't always know why we act as we do, but we can feel the consequent emotion immediately--for instance, shame. 
 Mr. Browne, the English teacher, asks his students to observe monthly precepts. September's precept: Given the choice between being right or kind, choose kind. This story, without being pedantic, is the perfect anti-bullying book. Every class should read it. 
 The book shows people behaving both badly and wonderfully. I guess that's why the name is so apt. ""Wonder."" I loved this book.

I read this book because I saw it was highly rated and I also wanted to see if it was something my kids should read. I really liked it and I do want my kids to read when they get closer to middle school age. I think it carries great lessons on kindness and encourages tolerance and acceptance and it really is a great book for the intended audience. As an adult reader, I did feel that it felt a little too wrapped up in niceness. I wonder if a boy so different would find friends so soon. Like other reviews I've read, I agree that the most convincing and compelling voice was that of Via. One of my favorite things she said was how the family has spent Austin's childhood convincing him that he is just a normal kid, when the truth was, he was not. Via's emotions were sometimes raw but so honest and real, and this really added to the story. My favorite part was (spoiler alert) during the field trip when his classmates took up for him to protect him from the bullies, and how this became a turning point for his experience at school. As for the award ceremony, did anyone else think it should have been Summer and Jack that should have gotten the final award? All in all a great fast read that I would definitely recommend.","Sat Dec 01 17:45:52 -0800 2012","Sun Dec 30 18:54:37 -0800 2012","Sun Dec 30 18:34:56 -0800 2012","Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 -0800 2012",0,0,""

Wonder appears to be aimed at kids of perhaps ten upwards, but it's an equally engaging and moving read for an adult and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
 We all know that starting a new school at all is hard enough as it is, but things are doubly difficult for Auggie, whose facial disfigurement is so significant that he is fully accustomed to people visibly recoiling when they meet him for the first time, even if they think they're hiding their reaction. 
 As we follow him through his first year, Auggie is self-deprecating, quietly determined and, like most children of his age, an amusing and sometimes poignant mix of naive and astute. It's impossible not to root for him. However, a major strength of wonder is the introduction of perspectives other than Auggie's in the narrative. Wonder is among other things a book about how we perceive others, so it's only fitting that we hear not just from Auggie himself but from those around him. The sections narrated by Auggie's teenage sister Olivia, who is fiercely protective of her younger brother and yet at the same time acutely aware that his unique needs mean she will always play second fiddle, are particularly enlightening, but every voice struck me as vivid and authentic. 
 The toughest challenges Auggie has to overcome are related to his appearance, of course - but anyone who can remember being eleven will be familiar with typical anxieties like their first overnight school trip, mysteriously shifting social cliques and peer pressure to grow up too soon, and there is much in Wonder that any reader can identify with. 
 If I have a criticism of Wonder it's that there are times when Auggie's parents seem a little too understanding, a little too indulgent, even, to be true, and I would have liked to see a little more complexity in their characters. It's also fair to say that Wonder isn't particularly plot-driven. But it's a lovely, oddly life-affirming read that reminds us of some simple but vital truths, good and bad, about human nature, and although there a couple of heartbreaking chapters, I'd defy anyone not to finish this book smiling.","Tue Dec 03 00:03:07 -0800 2013","Sat Dec 07 15:04:33 -0800 2013","Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Tue Dec 03 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

The novel is written mainly from Auggie's persepective though half way through the novel we are treated to a rerun of events through the eyes of different characters, his sister Via, her boyfriend Julian, Auggies' school friend Summer, and so on. This is great if you don't really engage with Auggie though I must say I got a little tired of this conceit in the end. 
 Suitable for any children from age 8 onwards depending on their maturity and reading levels but probably aimed at 10-12 year olds. The opening chapters' fart jokes mercifully disappear very quickly and much of novel is fairly serious though the children are depicted as having fun; it's not all doom and gloom all the time. 
 I suppose that was my problem with it. It was a bit too American- cheerful and worthy. I kept comparing it with another of this year's Carnegie books: The Weight of Water, which, while optimistic in the end, went through a lot of pain in the mid section. Part of that is because it is aimed more at the 12-14 market, but I can't help thinking that part of it reflects a British outlook rather than an American one! 
 So if you are generally of a cheerful disposition and like uplifting tales of personal struggles and bravery, then settle down with a box of tissues for the final 30 pages and enjoy! 
 Moved it down to a 2*. As a novel for this genre and age group it is a 3* but for. But for me personally a 2*. OK but I would hope I never have to read it again.","Fri Apr 19 12:14:35 -0700 2013","Fri May 31 04:15:07 -0700 2013","Fri Apr 19 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,"False"

 Literally couldn't put this book down once I started reading it. August Pullman, the protagnist, hooked me up since the introdution. Born with facial deformities, none can imagine what kind of life Auggie must go through. Being given 'that' look; getting mocked; called names; and worse, bullied. Lucky he still has supportive family and friend. 
 But I can't thonk how real life Auggies live their life. I once knew a girl whose face was slightly deformed -uneven eyes and sideloped nose. I hid her whole Facebook post because she regularly posted selfies, which made me felt uncomfortable. But let's just get back to the book rather than listening to my misanthropic banter. 
 This book has many narrators: Auggie himself, his friends Jack, Summer and Miranda, his sister Via, her boyfriend Justin. Palacio succeed in giving different perspectives through these narrators. But honestly, though, she can skip Justin's part because it's not that necessary. Maybe she wanted to give more perspective about Via's character, but STILL THO' 
 I said that this book tasted like Thai tea which is too sweet for my taste but I still enjoyed it somehow. Kinda unrealistic but hey, this is a story, fiction. There's no way a real life Auggie could get a medal by just being himself: smart ass kid who basically did nothing while his friends protecting and encouraging him. If anybody deserves the medal, it was Jack Will. Not Auggie. 
 Despite the heart-warming story, I still feel a little annoyed with some details like how doting Auggie's parents are towards him even though they said their son need no special treatment and stuff. This book still hold tight to the paradigm of how delicate and 'special' handicapped people are. Stop giving them special treatment and just interact with them the way you are with everyone else. 
 But good point is, don't judge a book by its cover (which I refuse to do and I consider as an excuse ugly people spout when they just lack everything). Auggie might look different but he still has a kind heart, smart brain, and good sense of joke if you just give him a chance.","Sat Feb 25 23:50:44 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 26 00:56:02 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 26 00:56:03 -0800 2017","Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2017",0,0,""

It bumps down to a 4.8 when I remember that the ending wraps things up just a little too nicely. Kind of like the saccharine tone of the Boxcar Children or Anne of Green Gables, Wonder provides a neatly wrapped little package of an ending, satisfying and shiny. As superficial as that sounds, the rest of the book was phenomenal. 
 I can see why it perhaps didn't quite get onto the Newbery list, but then again, I don't know that I would put The One and Only Ivan above it. Perhaps it's one of those under-appreciated books that then begins to shine as soon as kids start to read it. 
 Told from multiple perspectives, but always focused on this one boy, Wonder tells a coming of age story via August's first year of middle school. The year we experience is his first foray into formal schooling: he was homeschooled for most of his life because of his multiple medical conditions. His time in the 5th grade is full of ups and downs as he grows into himself. His face differs from other children's to an extent that makes people stare and comment, sometimes even feel fear. Learning to deal with peers in a mature manner is only one of the obstacles he has to work with in his new life. The social fabric of middle school is complicated, and he finds that his family and friends are his biggest supports when he needs them most.","Sat Jan 12 07:12:38 -0800 2013","Sun Jul 27 14:44:48 -0700 2014","Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Sun Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

However, I did this without actually reading the book first. This was a HUGE move on my part (and not the smartest), but all the reviews were excellent and the last book they read was a total flop, so I figured I couldn't wrong. And, I didn't. 
 I read this book in one day--I couldn't put it down. I also have had several students email me, saying that they have already finished it, too (and they are not ""readers""). 
 This book is golden. It deals with many issues that young children are faced with. Some of my favorite topics that I look forward to discussing with my students are bullying, self-acceptance, peer influence, and friendship. Obviously, if you've heard anything about this book, you know that bullying presents itself many times and in many ways. I like that RJ presented bullying on different levels, because sometimes students don't see the ""smaller"" acts as being bullying. Nor do students see the snowball affect their actions may have. So quickly, someone can go from name calling to physically hurting someone. This is something that needs to be brought to students' attention. 
 This book is written from many viewpoints. Of course, Auggie's POV is seen the most throughout the novel, but his sister, Via, had my favorite ""part."" I liked the real and mature emotions that Via brought to the book. Auggie's emotions were real, no doubt, but since he is only 10 years old, there were a lot of serious things that went above his head. Via, being in high school, saw and understood more things that Auggie. She also, tactfully, talked about the negative side of having Auggie as a brother. By seeing Via feel overlooked and not always happy with her family's situation was so authentic AND was written beautifully. 
 I could go on and on about this book, but, since I should be grading semester finals, read it yourself over Winter vacation. It's a quick read that will stick with you long after you finish.","Mon Dec 16 06:16:37 -0800 2013","Mon Mar 24 09:24:35 -0700 2014","Sat Dec 14 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",0,2,""

 Wonder by R.J. Palacio (YA) 
 August (Auggie) was born with a facial deformity. Up until now (the 5th grade) he has been home schooled. He decides to try 5th grade in a regular school. He expects to be treated oddly by some but while that is true, Auggie is also pleasantly surprised by others. Auggie strives to come into his own during this first year of school. 
 I loved this book. Auggie was a wonderful character. He was brave, funny and genuine. There was a wonderful cast of characters in this book--Auggie's parents and sister, Jack Will, Summer and the middle school principal. I recommend this book.

 At the recommendation of my niece, Wonder has been on my TBR list for a while. She enjoyed it this past summer and with this glowing recommendation, my son and I picked it out earlier this month. He no longer likes to be read to, choosing to read independently, so the initial plan was to keep up with each other. Today when started I was pondering what book that I might be able to finish by midnight, he suggested that I go ahead and finish reading Wonder. 
 Wonder is a great book for the grade 4-6 crowd and tells the story of August (Auggie), a boy born with a severe facial abnormality. He had so many surgeries that he had been homeschooled up to that point. His parents felt that it was time to start attending a regular school with his peers. Although he was used to stares, quiet comments and shock expressed by others related to his appearance, starting grade 5 was not easy for Auggie. Kids can be mean! Being different is not easy! 
 In the end, Auggie makes friends. He wins them over with his great personality and they learn to accept the differences which make him Auggie. His family is there supporting him all the way! 
 This is a great book that would be fantastic to read to a grade 4 or 5 class. It would prompt frank discussion about others who may have challenges and the fact that EVERYONE is struggling for acceptance and kind words and actions can make ALL the difference! I liked how the book was broken down into chapters which were narrated by different characters, sharing their individual perspectives. 
 I enjoyed Wonder and am looking forward to chatting about it with my niece and son.","Sat Dec 31 18:55:02 -0800 2016","Sat Dec 31 18:56:31 -0800 2016","Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 -0800 2016","",0,0,""

 A coming of age tale that works through the regular and ups and downs of adolescence with the bittersweet difference of, well, being really, unavoidably different. 
 While the story of Auggie, told from multiple points of view, runs the gamut of emotions and ends on a true feel-good note, its one and only downfall is the clear-cut, all's well that ends well resolution and the amount of time spent getting there and within the actual ""moment"" of conclusion. Had things been left a little less perfect, or perhaps if Palacio had left a lingering question about Auggie's future -both within the walls of his middle school and beyond- with the feel-good resolution to the story at hand, I could have given five stars. 
 Regardless of my qualms with the ending, this book is fabulous and I recommend it to all.","Mon Sep 16 10:01:42 -0700 2013","Wed Sep 02 09:10:31 -0700 2015","Sun Nov 10 11:50:39 -0800 2013","Sun Oct 06 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

It's a tale about a young boy called August, who was born with an extremely rare genetic mutation that has caused his face to look a little bit different. He's been homeschooled all his life until his parents decided to let him enter middleschool. Auggie has to deal with many stares and awkward glances, but he's okay with it, and understand why people react this way. However, Auggie stars to have some trouble at school, some of the kid's aren't so nice and as a result he starts to regret his decision. 
 I absolutely adored this book, I managed to finish it in one night because once I really got into the story, I couldn't get out again. The writing is entirely captivating, and yet reminiscence of a young boy, and feels like an accurate reflection on how a boy this age would behave and react to situations. It's told though multiple perspectives, a technique that worked surprisingly well and allowed a lot of insight into the motives and reasons behind why particular characters behaved certain ways. It showed how easy it is to be mislead about a person's character. And how we shouldn't make rash judgements about people based merely on what we see. There's a lot going on behind closed doors, you could say. 
 August's sister Via is an incredibly strong and selfless character, accepting that auggie would always come first and yet never holding it against him. She is very admirable. 
 The tone suited the theme perfectly, and I thought Auggie was a brilliant protoganist. He has a knack for making everyone laugh and I just want to hug him.

Through the book, we encounter his parents' fear of how he may be treated, the reactions of classmates, reactions of adults, and the bullying that occurs toward Auggie. 
 This story is a remarkable tale and written in a special way that allows the reader to see through the eyes of not just Auggie but, also, his friends and sister. It is a tale of courage, love and going beyond differences. Auggie and his classmates go on a journey together, and it is a beautiful story. 
 I loved how real the story was and how the simple reactions and dialogue the characters had were realistic and the actions felt as if this were something that really occurred and not just a work of fiction. You feel for Auggie when the bullying occurs, and you feel the courage of his friends and Auggie. It is a book that I plan to read again and again.

 Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the novel, I just wasn't blown away by it. 
 I liked August a lot. I wanted to hug him the entire way through the novel. I feel that August's character was the strongest element of this novel. 
 However, the novel, for me, was let down by the use of multiple narratives. The different perspectives added very little to the overall plot and having finished the novel, I find that I've already forgotten what the other narratives actually revolved around. None of the voices really stood apart from each other. Justin's narrative seemed particularly unnecessary and the lack of punctuation was something that grated on me quite a lot (but that might simply be a personal gripe.) I feel that the story could have easily just been told from August's perspective and would've worked just as well. 
 The story as a whole, whilst a nice read, was also a little too cutesy for me. The ending simply didn't have that much of an impact on me. The book had some nice sentiments but I didn't feel particularly affected by it upon finishing. I'd recommend this novel if you're looking for something light and heartwarming but if you're looking for a novel to really cut deep or to give you something to think about, then this isn't the book for you.","Wed Aug 22 06:17:55 -0700 2012","Mon Apr 22 14:33:05 -0700 2013","Mon Apr 22 14:33:05 -0700 2013","Wed Apr 17 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

 Wonder comfortably fits in the YA category - the underlying premise is deceptively simple and the chapters are 2-3 pages long, but the characters are incredibly rich and poignant (I admit that they sometimes seem to fit a mold too cleanly, but I'm willing to give on that angle - I don't always mind having clear good guys and obvious bad guys).

Then, when I come to write down what I liked and what I struggled with, I realise that there was a lot that I struggled with in this book, but there was a lot I liked too. So, I am going to be kind and stick with my initial four stars, and I'll explain why it could have been three stars. 
 August is 10 years old. He has a terrible facial abnormality, which has meant serial surgical procedures for most of his short life. Because of this, he has been homeschooled up until now. August lives with his Mom, his Dad, his sister Via and his family dog, Daisy. At the beginning of the book Auggie finds out that his Mom and Dad have been going through the process of enrolling him at a school, because Auggie needs to learn more than his Mom can teach him, and she's not just talking about fractions: 
 '""We can't keep protecting him,"" Mom whispered to Dad, who was driving. ""We can't just pretend that he's going to wake up tomorrow and this isn't going to be his reality, because it is, Nate, and we have to help him learn to deal with it. We can't just keep avoiding situations that..."" 
 ""So sending him off to middle school, like a lamb to the slaughter..."" Dad answered angrily, but he didn't even finish his sentence because he saw me in the mirror looking up.' 
 EVERY parent who reads that is going to be thinking about their own 'letting go' challenges. All of us have had those moments where we are sending our children into the unpredictable and not necessarily kind world. We know the instinct to protect, for just a little while longer, even as we know that we should let go. How much harder is that choice in this case? 
 Readers in their early teens will know how hard it is to start a new school, wanting to get things just right, wanting to make the right impression. How many books have been written about just that?! 
 Doesn't it make us all feel a little bit ashamed of the days we haven't wanted to go out in public because it's a fat day/a big zit day/a bad hair day/an I said a stupid thing yesterday day...We all know that moment when we have to brace ourselves, be a bit more courageous than we want to be, and get on with it. Most of us are dealing with something much less significant than Auggie, and yet we recognise an element of it. 
 That's where this book has it over us. Because, 'whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.' We are, like Via, on the moral back foot. Via is four years older than Auggie, and she can only remember glimpses of time without him being around. Her story is equally as compelling as Auggie's. Via tells the story of what it is like to be Auggie's sister. It is hard for her to admit that she has needs, when - always - Auggie's needs are greater. But moments of self-pity, and let me say that self-pity is normal for a teenager, when she sees Mom standing outside Auggie's door late at night just looking in and wonders if Mom has ever done that at her door, paint a realistic picture of feeling a little bit less loved than her brother, of getting less time and attention. However, when she gets to go to a new school, where the kids don't know about her little brother, she revels in her anonymity. She becomes Olivia, and makes some new friends, including a boyfriend. None of this is without some fairly normal teenage challenges like learning to cope with not being in the popular group, and how friendships change. All of which have been the MAIN storyline of many a book, but are peripheral in this one. As Via says, 'August is the Sun. Me and Mom and Dad are planets orbiting the Sun. The rest of our family and friends are asteroids and comets floating around the planets orbiting the Sun...But this year there seems to be a shift in the cosmos. The galaxy is changing. Planets are falling out of alignment.' Hmmmm...a useful, but well-worn, metaphor. 
 The story of Auggie's settling in to school has its highs and lows, as might be expected. Some fairly predictable plot devices are used, like the quirky girl who could be in the popular group, but chooses to sit at Auggie's lunch table, the boy who struggles between peer pressure and conscience, and the boy who fakes nice in front of the adults. I felt that the age of these kids was really indeterminate...they wandered from sounding between 8 - 10years (for example, Auggie often calls Mom and Dad Mommy and Daddy) and 12 - 14years. 
 I'm not sure, either, about some of Mr Browne's 'precepts'. They felt contrived, and I'm not sure they entirely worked as a plot device. Subtlety would have been better than smacking us in the face with the morals of the story. And I didn't even know how many of them I really agreed with, or felt like they were worth a month's scrutiny. For example, 'When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.' Ummm...since when could you be unkind and be right??? So then, are we supposed to be 'kind' (read patronising) to Auggie. Since when is that kind? Doesn't he deserve true kindness, which would always be right. For that matter, don't we all? I'm still struggling with that one. So, maybe it is worth a month's scrutiny! 
 Another plot device that seems to be popular at the moment, is the multiple perspectives device. This works when all the voices are unique. Books like 'Bluefish', by Pat Schmantz and 'Because of Mr Terupt', by Rob Buyea, do this really well. In 'Wonder' the voices just don't feel significantly well characterised, although it does allow the reader the chance to review scenes in the book to learn a little more. 
 But a good book provokes, doesn't it? And this book did provoke thought. And I am sure it would be a great book to use in class, although it is somewhat clumsy with its morals. Great discussion could be had over so many elements of the story. So long as it doesn't slip into being patronising, or over simplified. This book had some heroic attempts at reminding us that we are all human, and we struggle to make the best decisions we can with the resources we have, and that we won't get it right all the time. And that's a great message to remember. I wish that had been a Mr Browne precept. 
 So, all in all, I liked the book. Maybe I even really liked the book, but it wasn't without its challenges. Ultimately, though, I am still inclined to err towards a four star rating.","Sat Mar 30 15:14:20 -0700 2013","Sat Mar 30 16:39:42 -0700 2013","Sat Mar 30 16:39:42 -0700 2013","",0,0,""

She cares about Auggie a lot and was willing to sacrifice many important part of her life to him. I also like Auggies's friends, Jack and Summer too.

It happened to be her right hand, the one you use to shake hands, so it was something that was noticed often. It never changed who she was, but peoples reactions can be harmful without realizing it. 
 As I read about Auggie's condition at the beginning, I liked how they didn't go into detail right away, but made you come up with your own image based on what they did give us.

 [*****] 5 Stars. 
 If I act like the objective grown-up I'm supposed to be, I should give this book 4 stars. Problem with that would be that I love my ""Queen of Biased Feels"" title a little bit to much so yeah... there goes being mature. 5 SHINY RED STARS FOR YOU, BUDDY! *smiley face* 
 ----- 
 Okay, I should try to redeem myself or something here. I'm physically disabled, or handicapped, or whatever normal people think people with medical issues are, and have been using crutches to walk ever since I can remember. 
 Side Note: I've always had problems with the word ""normal"". That's a word used in Physics for a kind of force. It's also used to casually describe the weather. That's about it. People misuse it for ""common"" when they're trying to mean ""average"". No living thing can be normal! 
 This may seem like a random invite to my personal life but it's not; it's my reason for why I'm specifically and extremely biased when it comes to ""Wonder"" and the emotions it evokes in me. All those things Auggie (the protagonist) has gone through, I've experienced at one or another point in my life. It's baffling and extremelly tiring to have to pretend not to notice strangers on the street throwing furtive looks your way when you're just innocently strolling down the street and had never comitted any type of crime to justify their behavior. Now, how am I supposed to NOT give this book the whole 5 stars? 
 Protagonist was too naive and forgave too easily for my liking. There's a few situations in where I would have reacted in a different way than him, even at his age (10 years old), but then again I'm a different person myself, more detached towards people (darn defense mechanisms!). Still, for the most part it felt a lot like reading my autobiography. 
 Aside from Auggie, I disliked every single character in the book with only three exceptions. Either they annoyed me, bored me or made me feel betrayed on his part. Every one of them, except for the one exception, got on his good side by the end of the story. I don't quite get how he can be so understanding to the point of Oh-My-God-what-are-you-doing? but whatever, apparently I'm a cold-hearted hater of humanity or something along those lines. 
 This spoiler/rant over here is what irked me the most: Again, what the heck is this bullsh*t? Your ""best friend"" rips your heart off right out of your chest but oh, he sent you a ""Hope u friend me agen cuz im really sorry"" text message and all of a sudden everything's alright? Really?! 
 Moving on, moving on... Since it's targeted to young kids, I guess the author wanted to deliver us a lesson or two about kindness, courage and hope. She did a good job but by the end of it all it was a little bit too hopeful. I love the feeling, I swear I do, but it's so not how reality works. If this were real life, poor Auggie would have had it a heck of a lot worse than this. 
 A few necessary mentions: The parents are all kinds of kick-ass and I'm adopting them as my own, I don't care that they're fictional characters. Summer is an extremelly good friend and everyone should be just like her, kinda-weird-and-awkward people are always the best sort of people. 
 Favorite Character: Mr. Tushman. What is this man anyway? I'm not even sure there's someone infinitesimally similar to him in existence. Award for most awesomesauce awesomeness in a human being ever in forever and ever, ever goes to him. Cheers! *clapclapclap* 
 Favorite Quotes: ""'Shall we make a new rule of life... always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary.'"" -- Mr. Tushman (extracted from The Little White Bird by J. M. Barrie), page 299. 
 Favorite Chapters: A Simple Thing; Awards; Floating.

As an avid reader/member of Goodreads, I enjoy my contemporary fiction and women's literature as well as memoirs and historical fiction, but I also like to read the books that my students (and years ago, my own kids), are reading. Lately I find that the genres geared towards kids are more science fiction, fantasy, and dystopian, none of which inteterst me. But my friend advised me to read this realistic fiction book geared towards 5th and 6th grade, and a couple of days later, someone on the Today Show panel also gave it a thumbs up for this age group. 
 August is a ten year old boy who was born with severe facial deformities and has gone through many surgeries throughout his life. Until now, he has been home schooled, but his parents feel that he should try to navigate the real world and want him to start middle school as a 5th grader. This novel follows his experiences in middle school where he encounters all of the challenges that ""normal"" kids do...cliques, bullying, trying to fit in....the usual challenges which are made that much more difficult due to his unique situation. Although there are times that August feels like he cannot stand it anymore, he is basically a secure child because of his close knit family who loves him unconditionally and have given him a sense of self esteem that he didn't even know he had. The interesting thing about this book is that the author tells the story through different points of view. The story is August's story, yet we hear from his older sister, who has had her own issues to deal with and speaks with the wisdom of a sibling of a special needs child, the two students who become friendly with August, one by request and one by choice, the sister's boyfriend, and the sister's former best friend (the two girls had drifted apart during this year of high school). The author demonstrates through this literary technique how August has pulled all these people together, and the strength of his personality has taught them all important lessons about character, kindness, and compassion. The characters are realistic and sympathetic, the events real, and the description of school so vivid that I could visualize this in any school today. The situations are life events; at times I laughed, and other times I needed a pack of tissues.I read this in one day, and I feel it is an important book that parents shoulc read with their children. It would be a teachable moment; bullying is rampant in school, and children are targets for any reason, not just a disability. This book could provide a springboard for discussions about the challenges of middle school, for students, parents, and teachers.","Wed Jul 03 10:39:36 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 03 10:57:59 -0700 2013","Wed Jul 03 10:57:59 -0700 2013","Tue Jul 02 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,1,""

 Wonder is the story of August Pullman, a boy about to go into fifth grade at Beecher Prep. August has never attended an actual school before-he's always been too sick. But he's stronger now...physically. August was born with a facial deformity which has required him to have 27 surgeries in his first eleven years. 
 August considers himself an ordinary boy: inside. He knows others don't see him that way when they look at his face. According to August: 
 ""I think the only person in the world who realizes how ordinary I am is me."" 
 The story of August's fifth grade year is told from a variety of viewpoints: August, his sister Via, Via's childhood friend, a fellow Fifth Grade student, and Via's new boyfriend. Each narrator brings insights into his or her own behavior and feelings which enhance the complete story. Each voice is unique and genuine. 
 This book is by turns joyful, heart-rending, hopeful, hilarious and inspiring. The story is about more than one boy's journey to continue accepting himself and sharing himself with others. It is about love and friendship and family. It is about growing in compassion and kindness and opportunities to exist with each other in this world together as triumphant spirits of everything that makes life exquisite. 
 It speaks to us of the choices we make for ourselves and in our attitudes and behaviors toward others. It speaks to the difficulty of making those choices. We all know that the 'right' choices are rarely the easy ones. So how do you find the courage to make them anyway? The various narrators give us examples from their perspectives. Then it's up to us. 
 August reflects 
 ""It's like people you see sometimes, and you can't imagine what it would be like to be that person, whether it's somebody in a wheelchair or somebody who can't talk. Only, I know I'm that person to other people, maybe to every single person in that whole auditorium. 
 To me, though, I'm just me. An ordinary kid."" 
 Although I know we won't be able to finish it before the school year is up, I began reading it to my two Fourth Grade classes this past week. I found it to be such a magnificent, soaring read for me that I am hoping some of the students will be motivated to get the book from the library and finish it on their own this summer. Although we were only able to get 11 pages into it in one class and 15 with the other, neither class wanted me to stop when we ran out of time! I am soooo looking forward to reading with them again our last two weeks!

Palacio has become a 'publishing sensation' dealing sensitively with the rare issue of cranio-facial anomalies but also tackling more widely stuff around being a kid, who's in, who's out, friends, enemies and frenemies. It does so beautifully in the main with the story told from August 'Augie' Pullman's view of his first ever foray into the public world of 'middle school' after being home-schooled. Augie is a sweet, engaging character who has grown accustomed to the double-take his appearance causes in others. He loves Star Wars and his dog, Daisy, his favourite day of the year is Halloween when he can hide behind a mask like everyone else in New York. Chapters told from other points of view (sister, sister's boyfriend, friends etc) didn't work for me, detracting from Augie's viewpoint and adding little. The ending was upbeat; Augie becomes accepted and popular even, albeit in a class mascot type of way. Are kids ever this nice? Not in my experience.

 When Auggie begins fifth grade, his parents decide to send him to school. How Auggie, his family, and his classmates deal with Auggie's transition to school during one school year forms the basis of the storyline. I appreciated the honesty of his situation and how other children respond to Auggie at school. Many kids tease Auggie and the author also shows how Auggie is excluded without being openly bullied. 
 Wonder is a remarkable book about courage, love, and the difference one person can make in the lives of others. Auggie is an inspiring person because he is just an ordinary kid. It isn't just Auggie who inspires you, though, his parents, older sister, his teachers, and his friends and their families show their strength and love for Auggie in their daily interactions with him. 
 While the ending was a little bit like a Hallmark movie, I thought it was appropriate to the mood of the story and the characters' actions.

He's been home-schooled up to now, his parent's attempt to protect him from the meanness of other kids. But now he's going to start fifth grade at a real school. 
 The book follows Auggie's experiences of the fifth grade as he tries to make friends and deal with the reactions of the other kids and tries to find a way to fit in. That's hard for any kid, but for Auggie, it's even tougher. As well as Auggie's experiences, we also follow the experiences of those whose lives he particularly touches - his older sister, Via and her boyfriend, Justin, and friend Miranda, and two kids from his grade - Jack and Summer. 
 My favourite character in the book was Summer. She's a very smart girl with her head screwed on right who makes a point of befriending Auggie on the first day of fifth grade, and one of the few kids who is able to see past his disfigurement right from the start. 
 All the characters were great, and while Auggie had the most obvious problems to deal with, the other characters all had things in their lives or problems they had to deal with too, never mind just trying to survive fifth grade (in Auggie, Jack, and Summer's case) or high school (in Via, Miranda, and Jack's case). 
 A really great book, with moments that made me want to cry, and moments that made me laugh out loud, and moments that made me want to hug some characters (especially Auggie) and strangle others (especially this kid in Auggie's class named Julian, and Julian's awful mother).

Wonder tells the story of Auggie's first foray into 'real school' after years of homeschooling by his understandably protective parents.

 I finally got to it because of a recommendation from Izzy; I'm so glad that it didn't languish forever on my to read list, as do most of my ""to read"" books. 
 I loved August's voice so much that at first I was disappointed when another voice/several characters' voices started narrating the story. However, I ended up really appreciating the multiple perspectives. All of the kids' points of view are done perfectly, both the fifth graders and the ninth graders. 
 I had heard that there was one, and I could tell ahead of time what the sad animal moment would be, but at 10 I might not have seen it coming. 
 The story is very touching, and very funny, and very sweet. The ending was not my favorite, but that's okay; it worked well enough, and I appreciated why it ended the way it did. 
 I have some theories about one of the characters who wasn't given a voice, and I see that there is a published short story told from his point of view, but this book was so perfectly put together that I don't know that I have much interest in reading it. 
 I enjoyed seeing all the precepts included at the end of the book. 
 This is a great book about bullying, being kind, doing the right thing, being courageous, good teaching, friendship and family, and I respected how it didn't talk down to kids. I remember having these same kinds of deep conversations and thoughts when I was the age of Auggie and his classmates, and I think most readers around age 10 will identify with this group of kids. I also think that this could be a life-altering book for some young readers. And, it was simply a fun read and hard to put down. Very engaging.","Tue May 01 16:12:31 -0700 2012","Sun Jul 03 02:18:32 -0700 2016","Fri Nov 21 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Tue Nov 11 00:00:00 -0800 2014",14,5,"False"

In fifth grade, as middle school begins, he starts attending a small private school. The story is both jarring and inspirational. I liked the way the author tells the tale through various characters eyes: August, his sister, his friends. It gives a unique perspective to how everyone is feeling as they undergo this huge change in life.

I also enjoyed hearing from his friend Jack and his sister, those two perspectives really added to the story and made me think about how everyone has their issues and complexities, not just the main character.

 Having this book in hand; made me remember the feeling of curling up in a sofa and flipping an actual book. Not flipping ""pages"" on Kindle app on my iPad. 
 This is such a beautiful book. Of course, the storyline is pretty much predictable but the way of execution, the story being told, it's amazing. Different parts of the books are told by different characters. We get to learn and understand how each characters felt. Their thought process, their feelings, their regrets. 
 I guess I always have a soft spot for kids who are bullied. And August Pullman was one of them. 
 I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. 
 August Pullman was born with a facial deformity that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid--but his new classmates can't get past Auggie's extraordinary face. WONDER, now a New York Times bestseller, begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. 
 In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel ""a meditation on kindness"" --indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can't blend in when you were born to stand out. 
 Such a delightful read and I managed to finish in 3 days. 
 You are always beautiful, in your own way. Don't let someone else tell you otherwise.","Mon Jun 11 06:33:30 -0700 2012","Thu Jul 04 23:50:52 -0700 2013","Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

When I read the blurb I sort of doubted whether I wanted to read it, thinking that it'd be aimed at children. 
 The book deals with Auggie Pullman starting mainstream school with a severe facial deformity, focusing on Auggie and his friends and family who narrate their sides of his story. 
 In retrospect I can't say that anything incredible or exciting happens and yet every time I put it down I wanted to pick it up again, there was definitely something compelling about it. 
 The only negative thing that I can say - and this is really what kept it at a three star rating - is that there were characters who could have been used as narrators who would have been harder hitting than some that were actually used. Justin and Miranda added absolutely nothing to the story plotwise or with their emotions/opinions. Yet there was absolutely no input from Auggie's parents. 
 How did Auggie's Dad react to his wife putting Auggie in school? Did Auggie's mum purposely choose Auggie over Via? How did Nate react to this? How did Isobel really deal with Auggie's school trip? 
 There was a lot of emotion that wasn't tapped into, which could have made this book a bit more stand out for me.","Tue Feb 19 10:56:31 -0800 2013","Fri Feb 22 11:08:34 -0800 2013","Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,"False"

It was quite easy to read, with short chapters, fun chapter titles, and quite a bit of humor (added by mostly by Dad). After finishing the book however, I'm not SURE it's for my boys (maybe when they are a bit older?), although I did really enjoy the book myself. 
 One of my boys is a bit of a hypochondriac and prone to panic/anxiety attacks (sometimes more than a bit, we were having a BAD day today, as I was trying to read this book) ... at first I thought this might be a good book for him to read (just to realize his problems are very mild and he is very lucky and healthy) but then, I don't know. I can see this book bringing up some stress points for him. The grandmother dying (having a stomach ache and going to the hospital, and not coming back out), the dog dying, the talk of heaven (also talk of reincarnation as an alternate possibility), and just the trials of any kid entering middle school (which he will be doing in a few months). I don't want him to worry about not having someone to eat with, or kids being mean and spreading rumors, fighting. Maybe after a successful transition to middle school I'd feel more comfortable with him and that aspect of the story. Maybe not something every parent needs to worry about, but those with kids sensitive to any of these topics may have some cause for concern. 
 Where we are at, elementary school goes through sixth grade. Middle school is 7-9. It is just a little odd to be reading about 5th graders being in Middle School (although I've seen it in the Big Nate books too). I was a little put off by the talk of ""relationships"" in this 5th grade class. That there were ""couples"" and they were ""going out"" and ""dating"" ... in 5th grade??? (or am I being naive?) MY boys (6th and 8th grade) aren't interested in girls ... or am I being naive again? Also the fact that the kids could wear masks at school for Halloween (not allowed here), and I don't think any of our schools would allow pink hair or tube tops (although Olivia does think that it is inappropriate for school). 
 There was a LOT of pop media references. A TON of StarWars stuff (but my boy does love StarWars too), Diary of a Wimpy Kid, ET, Miley Cyrus, Doogie Howser ... others I can't remember right off. Classic stuff too (Wizard of Oz, War and Peace), but things that if a child does NOT have a reference for, they might not ""get"" parts of the book. 
 The section outlining the genetics MAY go over the heads of some kids. It was a little technical, but interesting to me. I have a cousin whose child has a fatal disease, and it seemed like the same basic odds came into factor for it (with both parents being a recessive carrier). At the end of that discussion, Via thinks ""countless babies who'll never be born, like mine."" I read that as Via giving up the thought of having childen at all, so as not to risk having a child like Auggie, or even passing on the gene. 
 The story was heartbreaking and uplifting ... the attitude and treatment of August by different individuals was really interesting and you have to ask yourself, where would I stand, what would I have done? We come to understand Auggie, Via, Summer, Jack (even a glimpse at Jack's nanny from a memory he has). It would have been interesting perhaps to get more of an idea of Julian's thoughts, although the emails exchanged with the school and his mother do shed light on that. 
 The story here has a ""happy"" ending ... a standing ovation. A title tie in at the very last sentence. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds, imaginary though it is ...","Sun Apr 28 17:37:12 -0700 2013","Sun Apr 28 19:53:40 -0700 2013","Sun Apr 28 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",1,0,""

It was a heart warming story that makes you think about how kind you are to those around you. I think other 10 year old kids will read and love it as she did. 
 As an adult, I had some issues with the book. Yes it was a little too much bubble-gum-rainbows-and-unicorns for such a heavy topic. But I think as a 10 year old, you need that to temper the issues at hand. My biggest complaint was the change in narrators. I tend to dislike books that change narrators, simply because it is so hard to do that really well. I appreciate what it brings to a story, but if the tone of each narrator isn't distinct, well, that bothers me. With the exception of Justin's stream of conscious style with his aversion to capital letters, the other narrators kind of blend together. Again, that is an adult complaint, and one I doubt my daughter really noticed or cared about. 
 I thought this was a good book for tweens and teens to read, and one their parents should read along with them.

Now, the reason I cried was because the pet died, and I'm a sucker for the pet dying in the middle of all the other character struggles. (I bawled my eyes out during the Ramona and Beezus movie.) 
 Anyway, most of the book wasn't even about that. It was about a funny fifth grader who is mostly ordinary, except that his face isn't ordinary. 
 Auggie was so unstoppable. He didn't give up. In situations I would be terrified of, he kept going. He talked to people, made jokes, sat with others at lunch, invited friends over for a birthday party at the bowling alley, etc. He made himself approach other kids. I was shy enough to struggle with that, and I know how hard it is to go to perfect strangers and try to introduce yourself or ask to sit at their table or hang out with them. And I look fairly normal. I cannot imagine what strength it toook for Auggie to continually put up with rejection after rejection and still be so light-hearted and good-natured. He laughed at so many things! I loved it. 
 Plus, he had a lot of different interests, especially Star Wars. 
 I love that the book explored different povs, and you can see how different characters view Auggie. His sister cares for him, but she is definitely tired of the world revolving around him. She has her own struggles. She just started high school, lost some friends, got a boyfriend, tried out for the school play, etc. Most of her worries aren't even about her brother! 
 So, Auggie has to put up with a lot. He has friends who are mean behind his back. He has students who don't want to touch his skin. He has a sister who doesn't want to hang out with him. His hearing is getting worse. He's extra small for his age. He has to eat funny. He thinks he looks like a duck. Sometimes people stare. Sometimes little kids scream. 
 Writer thoughts: I'm a bit surprised this book is set in 5th grade as opposed to 6th grade. Most middle schools (that I've heard of) are 6th through 8th or even just 7th and 8th. Sometimes they'll include 9th grade. I guess there must be middle schools that start at 5th grade. 
 Why did RJP pick 5th grade, then? My guess is that 10-year-olds are old enough to make decisions but young enough to still want to have fun. They're not (usually) old enough for puberty, and Auggie and his classmates had enough going on to not have that complication thrown in. 10- and 11-year-olds are young enough to make up dumb games like Cheese Touch, but they're old enough to know that they're being rude. 
 Writers have to pick ages carefully, and I don't think this book would have had the same impact had Auggie been in 6th grade. He would have sounded too whiny, and it would have been weirder for him to keep crawling into his mother's lap.","Sat Sep 17 19:54:37 -0700 2016","Tue Jul 11 11:18:42 -0700 2017","Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 -0700 2017","",1,0,"False"

Yep, it was worth the all caps. Not only does R.J. Palacio do an absolutely wonderful job writing this story, it's a heart-warming, tear-jerking and all around awesome read. 
 Need more reason to read this? My friend, who isn't a big reader, was the one who highly recommended this one. That's right people. A non-book reader suggested this book. She's a teacher and reads it to her students as well. It's that kind of story. One that impacts you at any age. 
 ""Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the word."" - Auggie's Precept 
 It's mostly told through little Auggie (who I just want to hug), but there's a few chapters that are told from other people's perspectives. I wasn't prepared for it at first, but it works perfectly. Plus the book is full of gems to hold on to. 
 ""...but what I want you, my students, to take away from your middle-school experience,"" he continued, ""is the sure knowledge that, in the future you make for yourselves, anything is possible. If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God."" 
 It's amazing that this is a debut novel. I can't wait to see what R.J. Palacio comes out with next! I'll probably cry in that one too. Really, read this one people! 
 Have any of you read this one? What did you think? I think I need to go read it again. 
 ""He is the greatest,"" he finally continued, ""whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.""","Wed Oct 16 19:56:19 -0700 2013","Tue Feb 23 20:12:51 -0800 2016","Sun Nov 17 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Wed Nov 13 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,2,""

 August is a likable, but imperfect character. This is basically true of all the characters, including the various narrators and August's parents. They're all extremely believable, with the one exception of the 15-year-old boy who writes in all lower case and has insight beyond his years. One of the things I like about the variety of voices is that we see how everyone struggles with something (divorce, death of a parent, having less money than peers, etc.). No one has an easy road. We see not only how August is affected by his disability/difference, but also how his family and friends are affected. And I love, love, love how non-one-dimensional his sister and parents are. They're all good people, desperately trying to do their best. Slight spoiler: (The one exception to these round characters is Julian, the bully, who obviously gets his cruelty from his mother, but I think his p.o.v. would have been interesting. Instead, he's just there as a randomly mean kid who seems to have most adults fooled, and who conveniently disappears at the end.) 
 I also love, love, love the structure of this novel. Each narrator retells some of the previous events from his/her own perspective and then moves forward in the chain of events. I am a huge sucker for books with interesting structure. 
 As for the plot: Yes, things end a little too conveniently. It's all a little ""After School Special."" Yes, August's role as a sort of mascot (""little dude"") for his classmates feels condescending . August is a character I'd like to see revisited as a high school student, to see how his life and role in his school have changed. But this is a book that I want my kids to read when they're in 5th grade. It has so much to say about being different, standing up for what you think is right, and, above all, kindness.","Fri Apr 25 14:42:20 -0700 2014","Mon Feb 16 08:33:01 -0800 2015","Sat Apr 26 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Fri Apr 25 00:00:00 -0700 2014",3,0,"True"

 The story of Auggie surviving and thriving his first year of Public School in 5th Grade is told through the narration of different characters in the book. 
 Two of my favorite things about this book is the friendships Auggie is a part of at the school, and Mr. Brown's precepts. 
 And I love that the author wrote this story after having a bad experience with one of her children encountering a child who looked different. She wished she had handled it differently, and thus this story was born. 
 I also really love this quote - WHEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING 
 RIGHT OR BEING KIND, CHOOSE KIND.

 Wonder is a book where you cry in the corner and question yourself why the world is so cruel and why life has to be so unfair. I never cried so hard - literally sobbing in a book, that I actually put down it in a minute to grab my emotions because I can't read when my tears just keep on flowing - I thought my tear ducts has been severely damaged by this book. 
 If I could give 10 more stars for how amazing this book is. Hands down! 
 I wanted to kick myself for not knowing about this book for so long that I just read it today. I wanna thank my sister-friend for sharing this to me because my life has been not the same after reading this. I know that I have tons of favorite books, but I can say this is my second to the list. I love the writing style, how I got to connect with every characters in the book, how this is the first time I've read a 10 year old boy's point of view, and how every chapter in the book is like a ""life changing"" feeling for me. It was really written beautifully. 
 ""She's very pretty,"" Mom said. 
 ""Yeah, I know,"" I answered. ""We're kind of like Beauty and the Beast."" 
 (This really made me cry harder. I dunno why but I'm just hurt of what he said in this part.) 
 ******************* 
 The best part of why I love this book so much is because I didn't read the plot and just go in my gut that maybe this will be good, but I was so wrong. It's not just good or fine because once I started it, I CANT PUT IT DOWN. That's how amazing this story is. Beyond amazing! 
 A wonderful boy ""Auggie Pullman"" - who had change so many lives because of his compassion, loyalty, unconditional love and kindness. His pure heart and witty mouth. His sense of humor and his ability to be extraordinary, when all he wants is to be ordinary. He is not just extraordinary, but I think he's blessed. Blessed with bravery and courage. I'm in awe for him. 
 ""That's why your deeds are like your monuments. Built with memories instead of with stone."" 
 A book about Kindness. Friendship. Courage. Character. 
 ******************* 
 I also can't help but relate August Pullman to Bailey Sheen from Amy Harmon's ""Making Faces"". They are so alike in many many ways. I wish ya'll could read that book because it's truly inspiring too. ""Making Faces"", is actually my number one in my favorites of all time so you know how special this book is because this is my second favorite. ;-) 
 Anyway, I can't help but cry again while doing this review. I know I'm very emotional but this book just really punched me in the gut so many times because I have a loving nephew who has Down Syndrome.

 Lovely book, giving us insight into the life and struggles of not only the innocent people in this world that don't look ""normal"" but also their families, and their friends. 
 I was honestly expecting it to have a horrible ending, with something happening to Auggie to stop him from going to school or something that was a terrible act on the part of another human being, but all this book really showed me was the strength of human nature. Bravery, kindness, courage, friendship. 
 It occurs to the reader that even though Auggie didn't look like everyone else, he was probably the most well rounded child because he hasn't allowed his looks to influence his personality, like many of us do. All of the time he was just him an by being himself he was the most relatable and touching person. 
 It was really a beautiful read, highly recommended.","Sun Jan 13 11:30:40 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 26 07:13:09 -0800 2013","Tue Feb 26 07:13:09 -0800 2013","Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

 when given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind - Dr. Wayne W.Dyer 
 this story is about the struggling of a fifth grader, with an extraordinary appearance. now, i said it is extraordinary because i cannot even picture actually how August looks like. and i'm afraid that if i see a person like him somewhere, i'm afraid that i will give him the stare that everyone gave. because that would make me a bad person. 
 i love August's family. they are so supportive to each other. they fight, of course, but they know that all would be well the next day. 
 and August, i think, although he's only in a fifth grader, but i think he has a very sincere heart, a traits that we rarely seen on such a young age. (judging by how most of his friends been treating him, i'm gonna hold to this opinion). 
 and i love how the author wrote a character like Summer and Jack, quoting his mom; 
 'there are more good people on this earth than bad people, and the good people watch out for each other and take care of each other.' 
 i totally recommend this book to all. i wish there's a sequel for this. i am curious about August's life. his college life, his work, his married life. and i hope that Jack will end up with Summer. and Via will marry his boyfriend Justin and Miranda will find someone better for her.","Thu Jun 07 09:49:31 -0700 2012","Wed Apr 08 02:57:06 -0700 2015","Tue Feb 18 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sun Feb 16 00:00:00 -0800 2014",2,0,"False"

Like all of my other 5-star reviews, it was well-written, had a good story, and made me Love it so much I want to buy copies to put in the hands of like-minded readers. 
 After reading the description I very much expected a somewhat saccharine tale of a boy with a facial deformity experiencing all the cruelty of middle grade life plus some with an ultimately uplifting climax in which he finds one special friend of something wonderful happens to show he is indeed extra special, deep down. Instead, Palacio begins with the premise that August Pullman is, in fact, a normal boy with an extraordinary face and maintains this throughout. He has many of the weaknesses one might expect from a child that has experienced others' reactions to his features and a lifetime of being the center of his family's attentions-he is sometimes expects the worst from people and is occasionally a bit self-centered-but he also has a lot of strength and maturity befitting a 10-year old boy who has had to deal with a lot, and is still learning how to do so. 
 The story is told from a number of different viewpoints-not all characters central to the storyline, such as August's sister's boyfriend. Middle School Drama is portrayed in all of its superficial and childish glory, and adults-instead of serving as 2-dimensional heroes and villains-are as varied as the kids. Throughout this very eventful year in Auggie's life, all of the drama and uplift is realistic and well-motivated, characters are developed throughout the story, and by the end Auggie has grown up just as much as you'd expect-and no more. He is still a normal boy with an extraordinary face.","Tue Jul 23 08:43:41 -0700 2013","Tue Aug 06 13:12:06 -0700 2013","Tue Aug 06 13:12:06 -0700 2013","Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013",1,0,""

I was, at some middle point in the book, describing it to the people as ""The Elephant Man for kids"" but it's really more of an everyday life story about a community that is given the opportunity to grow.","Sun Feb 19 17:54:53 -0800 2012","Mon Feb 27 17:49:41 -0800 2012","Mon Feb 27 17:49:41 -0800 2012","Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 -0800 2012",5,1,"False"

Looking at the mirror and can't stop talking about how ugly and fat I am, babbling about all these gibberish things girls talk about all the time: wrong hair color, pants always 2 sizes too small. This read made me realize what a hypocrite I've become. I intend to change that. This book made me realize the things I've taken for granted. The smiles I've held, the small talks, the pat in the back to people who deserves it, the kind acts, the little wonders I can do that may or may not change someone else's life. All things considered, I can say, this is one of the best books I've ever read and that R.J. Palacio is now part of my favored authors. 
 This novel is very well-written. It's poignant and just perfect. It's like listening to the characters talk about something and you don't feel like reading, you feel like you're infront of them, listening to them and talking to them. The characters are so alive I actually hear them breath and see them smile.

 I'll preface my review with the thought that Wonder is not a YA book. YA readers and adults alike can read and enjoy it, but it's target group is for younger audiences. The main character is in 5th grader and is starting 'Middle School'. Middle school when I was that age was 7th-8th grade, so I wasn't aware that in other parts of the country that middle school starts in 5th grade. 
 Wonder started off easy enough, but it was just a little too perfect. The parents and sister of Auggie, who was born with a facial deformity, behave almost too good. Auggie is too well adjusted for having a deformity and numerous surgeries that have left him scarred and frightening looking. I'm not saying it was unbelievable, but it was just a little too Pollyanna for me. 
 But about 1/3 of the way in, the ball drops. Not really drops...it's more like a jump ball, and everyone is fighting and jumping to grab a hold of it again. The sweetness is gone and now it's just a fight to stay above surface. Friends and family are scrambling to make sense of it all. It's a masterful reversal leading into the second act. 
 I'm finding it hard to put into words how much I liked this story. 
 It's a sweet but at times brutally honest depiction of how classmates, adults, siblings, teachers and the physically deformed themselves deal with someone who is by all accounts grotesque. 
 Grotesque, yet not so in his spirit,behavior character or personality. I think the author purposefully had Auggie act and react to difficult situations in a positive way. He never lashed out or flipped tables over or reacted negatively toward the bullies. Yet, the bully problem took care of itself. 
 I'm not saying this ever happens in real life. But we honestly don't need another book dealing with bullies in a reactionary way, with vengeance and punishment meted out. But inwardly and theoretically, this is a perfect way for bullying to stop, with everyone coming to the conclusion that the kid is a jerk, the victim is a hero, and we all have a big party at the end. 
 I KNOW it's not realistic. But dammit, I like a happy ending. Who says books need to ALWAYS BE BRUTALLY HONEST in every single detail?

 This book takes the POV of several characters that relate to August and talk about their relationships with August. 
 I think the story that stands out the most, is Via, August's older sister, who has always been pushed to the side because August has always needed to come first. Via, who has just entered high school, has to deal with her own problems, loss of friends, a new boyfriend, shame of her brother, etc. 
 August is a boy who is easily bullied. I think this book shows a lot at how August could have gone the other way, to hit back and let the hatred of others rule him. But he rose above that. He's still insecure with who he is, but August is fundamentally a boy who tries to do the right thing. 
 Jack Will. I think honestly, even though August was the one that had to deal with all these problems, Justin, Via's boyfriend was right. August has the perfect family, the best friends anyone could ask for, and a wonderful home. Jack is a kid who knows he doesn't always do things right, but tries anyway. And it's much easier to like him because he failed yet got up anyway. 
 This is such a feel good book, I got so caught up reading it and I am aware that this is a poor review and I would love write more, but I honestly can't say anything else.

 It's an easy read about a though subject and it is a great way to show kids what you can do about bullying and how you can be more inclusive with other kids.

 I gave it 4 stars cause I have to admit I was hoping Jack with get the prize at the end.

 Auggie Pullman has never gone to school. Although his mother is convinced that he should attend Beecher Prep for the fifth grade, Auggie... not so much. He doesn't look like most of the other kids, his genetic conditions and countless surgeries have left him with a unique face, and August knows that middle school kids aren't always the nicest.

It made it easier to work his schedule around his many surgeries for his facial anomaly. Auggie was born looking differently than the rest of the world due to several genetic abnormalities coming together in one moment, something that only has a one in 4 million chance to happen. But it happened to Auggie, and now he is getting ready to start 5th grade in a private school. Auggie knows that he is just a regular kid hidden behind an uncommon face, but the question is whether his classmates will ever figure that out.

If I were a middle-school teacher, I would definitely teach this book in class. It offers an excellent opportunity for discussion of such topics as disability and difference and bullying. This book is a more effective way of teaching children about these topics than having a guest speaker or lecture, since through this book children can really get in the head of the main character (who is bullied because of his different-looking face), and thus feel empathy towards him. They can see how bullying effects someone and also what it is like to live as ""different"". The multiple points of view offered in this book also offered perspectives of people who are family members of or friends with a ""different"" person (the main character) and how they are affected as well. This book was below my reading level (and naturally so; I'm sure the intended audience is probably middle-schoolers), but I can still appreciate it because it involves such an important topic, and it is executed in a way that children will be receptive to.","Sun Oct 25 14:02:50 -0700 2015","Fri Oct 30 10:59:05 -0700 2015","Fri Oct 30 10:59:05 -0700 2015","Sun Oct 25 00:00:00 -0700 2015",0,0,""

 Auggie doesn't just look different from most kids, but he looks different enough to expect the double-take that kids and adults have done since he was born. Other than his severe facial deformities, he is a pretty normal, happy kid with a loving family and a few good friends. 
 Life changes dramatically when his family decides to stop home schooling him and send him to a middle school for the first time. He deals with bullies and friends and tries to navigate his first year in school. 
 This book is told from multiple points of view - from Auggie, his sister, her friends, his friends and a variety of people. Each voice is unique and honest. I would recommend this to anyone, but especially to kids in middle school, as it is an excellent way to help teach empathy.","Mon Nov 19 18:44:27 -0800 2012","Tue Aug 13 15:54:27 -0700 2013","Mon Aug 12 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Thu Aug 08 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,"False"

I had heard so many people say that they cried through this book that after I picked it up from the library, it sat in my bag for a week before I felt emotionally prepared to cry through a book. 
 Surprisingly, I didn't cry. I can see why some people do, but for me this book had so much hope and triumph in it that I didn't find it sad at all. Sure hard lessons are learned, and the kids can be mean in the book but still most every character in the book grows and triumphs over the obstacles. 
 I actually think this book has moved to the top of my newbury contenders list. The reason is not because I feel it is a better story than the other two that I have at the top of my list but because it is such a new and different topic. 
 So many books that have won the award are about either the civil rights era or coming of age stories. Although this is sort of a coming of age story it is about someone with a face deformity. I haven't seen a book like this win so I think it would be great if it did. 
 One other thing I really liked about this book is how many different perspectives the author put in the book. It was great that we were able to see how the different characters grew. I would have loved to have a perspective written from the point of view of the mom, but since this is written for a tweener audience, I understand why that perspective is not included.

The story will tug at your heart strings as it teaches you a powerful lesson about compassion and friendship.

Auggie's story is realistically told through his voice and shifts narrators throughout to include his sister Via, friend Miranda, and new school friends: Summer, Jack and Justin.

 Toward the end, I was crying tears of joy. And when I finished reading it, I was literally hugging this book. It's such a beautiful book, but it also made my heart hurt in some parts (Which makes it even more amazing). It makes you want to reach out and hug the whole world and to tell people how much you love them. It's uplifting and warm. Some of the things I like about this book: people of all ages will equally enjoy this novel. I can give this to my 9-year-old niece and she would love it! I'm a 20 year old and I was crying. The second thing I like about this book is the technique that the author used. This book had 6 POVs. I would normally say that it's too many because sometimes, I don't even enjoy books that are written in two perspectives. BUT, each perspective offered an insight into the main character's beautiful personality in a way that would be impossible to otherwise know. This is also another message I got: a person is more than just a person; in this book, we were given a chance to see what's going on with the six of the character's thoughts and why things ended up that way. Everybody needs to read this so you'll understand what I'm talking about. And to the people who have read it: that last line destroyed all my feels.","Tue May 06 12:48:57 -0700 2014","Thu May 08 20:25:40 -0700 2014","Thu May 08 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Tue May 06 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

The same day that my son's teacher's letter came home saying it was her favorite book was the day a friend shared a post from the Cleft Palate Association. She was hoping to win a copy. I figured that the universe was telling me to read the book so I ordered it. 
 For anyone reading this who doesn't know me, my son was born with a cleft lip. Craniofacial conditions are sort of near and dear to my heart. I spent years worrying that my son would have problems in school. As of right now he's 8 and has had a couple kids ask him about it but that's it. 
 I read part of this book in the waiting room at his craniofacial appointment - just a coincidence since we only go every other year but it was right after the book arrived. I had to keep stopping. No one wants to cry from a book in a doctor's waiting room :-) There was actually another mom there reading this book too. I almost went over to tell her how pleasant our experience with school has been but decided to just stay with my family. 
 I cried fairly frequently in this book but plenty of the cries were happy cries - relief that so many people are kind. I hope my son continues to have friends who roll with his cleft scar and don't worry about it. I hope my kids are always nice to kids who have more struggles than they have. 
 And now I'm off to drop the book in the lap of my 11-year-old daughter, who could probably use a reminder not only to be kind, but to be thankful that her start of middle school is less scary than August's.","Mon Sep 05 09:58:56 -0700 2016","Mon Sep 05 10:04:29 -0700 2016","Mon Sep 05 10:04:29 -0700 2016","",0,0,""

 What a WONDER-ful book. Such beautiful writing. R.J. is such an amazing writer: she can change her style so greatly so that the perspective-changing isn't the slightest bit confusing, as is the case with most books. 
 This book make me laugh out loud, and cry, practically at the same time. August is just such a loveable character, and when he's hurt, you hurt with him. 
 I loved Summer and Jack and all of his friends in this book--I also loved the Principal, Mr. Tushman. 
 The ONE PROBLEM I had with this book was Via. 
 Her character seemed to completely change between chapters. In one, she's defending August and standing up for him, and then she's screaming at him to ""grow up"" and that ""things aren't always about you, for once!"" and how she was neglected and such, when just a few chapters before she was stating that she understands why August needs more attention and that it never got to her. 
 ...... 
 no. 
 I can deal with mean characters, and stupid characters, and characters where you just KNOW everything is going to go wrong with, but unrealistically written characters? 
 nononononono. 
 no. 
 I'm sorry, but the only thing I liked about her was her boyfriend, Justin.

The characters that we meet in the story take us on a journey and transform the reader as the characters themselves discover things about themselves. The main character August (Auggie) Pullman is truly the hero of this novel. He is a character full of heart, patience, love, strength, and courage. Auggie's family and friends undergo transformations and are also heavily effected by Auggie. Palacio uses humor and heart to mold this story and melt your heart.

As a middle-school teacher who sees peer pressure and the cost of non-conformity (for whatever reason) up close every day, the book felt very real to me. Wonder will definitely be a must-read for the middle school population. It's also a contender for the Nevada Young Reader award this year.","Fri Jul 25 08:35:54 -0700 2014","Fri Oct 17 19:54:47 -0700 2014","Wed Oct 15 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 August Pullman, the main character, was born with a severe facial deformity. He needed to be homeschooled until he was 10 years old to accommodate all of his surgeries. The novel begins when his parents make the decision to send him to middle school. The story is told from several different perspectives, including August's sister and other children. Readers will empathize with him as he struggles to be accepted and find a sense of belonging. Any child who has ever been bullied or felt excluded will relate to August's experiences. His determination, courage, and sense of humor ultimately help him to succeed. This is a story which stresses the importance of kindness, compassion, and tolerance. It will uplift anyone who reads it.","Mon Mar 18 13:23:13 -0700 2013","Wed Apr 17 03:51:27 -0700 2013","Tue Apr 16 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Mon Mar 18 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

 I wanted to love this book, I really did. And honestly, I expected to love this book. Maybe that was the problem, maybe I let this get too hyped in my head and expected more than it was. Maybe it's just that I'm in a weird reading mood. Maybe the audio made me like it less than I would have otherwise, I don't know. All I know is that I didn't love this book like so many others do. 
 This book follows a boy named August who, due to genetics that cannot be controlled, doesn't look like other kids. He's had many surgeries to improve the function of certain portions of his face and head, but he still doesn't look like everyone else. And that makes him odd. To some it even makes him scary. So we follow, through the eyes of six different characters, August's first year in a school with other kids. It's fifth grade (which I guess is middle school in New York) and not everyone is kind. 
 I liked the premise, but I was not a fan of how the story was laid out. It's told in first person from six different perspectives, as I mentioned. Of the six, we probably get the most page time in August's head. Then we have his sister Via, his friends Summer and Jack, and Via's friends Justin and Miranda. And honestly, August was my least favorite perspective of the six. It makes sense to show his insecurities, because everyone is insecure at some point, and looking different and being noticed would obviously be hard for a ten-year-old, but August felt too sorry for himself. And that never seemed to change as the story progressed. There was too much self pity for me to connect with him. From the eyes of the others this wasn't that noticeable and I actually did enjoy his character. Jack was my favorite perspective, I had a lot of fun in his head. 
 Everything in the story is focused on August. And I know that's the point of the book, to show his adjustment to school, the way that people react to him, and to highlight the good and the bad sides of humanity, but it felt too focused on him. This is a personal thing, but for me the story would have been more powerful had it not focused so much on August and instead told a story around him. Obviously the way it's written works for most people, which is great, but for me it lessened the message when it made it seem like everyone was always talking about, thinking about, and worrying about August. 
 And maybe the environment that I grew up in was just very different, but I had a hard time believing that everyone would react the way that people reacted to August. Yes, bullying exists, and yes, I have seen it in action, but it was still hard to picture all of these people, adults and children alike, having to do a double take, unable to hold eye contact with him, refusing to talk to him, and calling him names. Yes, all of those things happen, but the scale seemed very heavily weighted toward that mindset in this story. 
 One of my goodreads friends, I can't recall who at the moment, mentioned in their review that this was too sweet, and I have to say that I agree. It's a good message to teach--not everyone is the same and we shouldn't hate because of those differences. At the same time though, this was a little over-the-top for me. Sometimes things don't go well, sometimes people don't like you, sometimes people are jerks and there is nothing you can do to change that, but you have to learn take it all, the good and the bad. 
 This isn't a horrible book or a bad book, it just didn't work for me. It has a powerful message and I think that it's important to remember to be kind, no matter what. There are some things about us that we can't control, but we can decide how to act. 
 I know this was made into a movie and is being released later this year, and I'm actually interested to see how they adapt it. It seems like some of my personal issues with the style of story telling might be negated in translation to film, so I'm interested to see how the two compare for me.","Wed Jun 01 06:05:53 -0700 2016","Fri Aug 11 06:56:55 -0700 2017","Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 -0700 2017",4,0,"False"

Every single sentence was read in this amazed sort of like whisper, which just got tiring after a while. 
 I found the story a bit heavy handed.

To be honest even though the story centers around Auggie what I loved most were the multiple POVs. Which were amazing! To be specific the POVs which I most enjoyed were those of both Via and Will which really showed character development and were in my opinion instrumental to the story. It would have been far too easy for Palacio to write the novel from Auggie's POV but she realized that for it to be an honest and authentic portrayal she would have to incorporate the experience of all those who Auggie touched. But with the good often comes the bad, I must say the first third of the book which was primarily if not completely Auggie's POV were to be quite honest unbearable. But alas I do think they were true to the character, they just weren't my favorite part of the story.

 I loved this book. The characters were so well written and I'm always a sucker for books with multiple narrators. 
 I found the way Via talked about her grandmother's death and her mother's response versus August's perspective of their mother's response to Daisie's death (and the fact that he seemed fairly unaware of his grandmother's death and the impact it had on his mother and sister) especially interesting. I loved August, but I think I especially loved him because he wasn't a pity case - he was complex and at times bratty and self centered, which made him so much more realistic. 
 I also loved the precepts and Mr. Tushman's speech about kindness. They were both profound without being too saccharine. This book was touching as well as interesting and engaging.","Mon Sep 16 12:53:51 -0700 2013","Fri Jan 03 07:36:02 -0800 2014","Sun Sep 15 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,""

The book is told from Auggie's perspective at first but also from his sister's and a few other friends and wraps up with Auggie again. A little simple in the way of writing but it worked. I guess I felt it was too forced. Too perfect. Maybe it was just meant to be a feel good story which is fine, but I had heard so many fantastic things about it that I guess I expected more. 
 Would I recommend it? Sure. It's a quick read, but for me lacked something.","Fri Sep 06 22:17:47 -0700 2013","Sun Sep 08 09:01:20 -0700 2013","Sun Sep 08 09:01:20 -0700 2013","Sat Sep 07 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0,""

Also, contrary to one reviewer's opinion, I actually like different points of view, because we see Auggie and the world around him not only from his point of view, but the point of view of other kids, like his sister or his friends. We see how he changed them.

The determining factors were that it was highly rated, had an important theme which would make for a good discussion and was short so it would be better to read during the busy Christmas holiday season. This book kept me, an adult in my late 30s, interested and even brought me to tears. It is heartbreaking while being uplifting and will be an exceptional weapon against bullying in school-age readers. Bullying and teasing are the main themes of the book since the main character is severely deformed and attending public school for the first time. The book begins with August Pullman's narration and we get a good feel for how his life has been, how he perceives himself and his family and his nervousness about attending public school. Once we have listened to Auggie's voice for a while, we are given different narrative perspectives from his family, friends, and even the bully. The book does a great job of allowing us to empathize with each of the characters from Auggie's sister Olivia Pullman to his best friends Summer Dawson and Jackalope Will. There is even a perspective from Auggie's main bully, Julian Albans. The book does a decent job of not turning anyone into a perfect altruistic good guy (except maybe Auggie) or evil bad guy (except Julian until the end when we hear his side.) If I had one complaint, it would be the bully's grandmother's story (it felt too contrived) and the way it immediately turned the bully around in the end. It felt like Julian did a 180 as soon as his grandmother finished the story and that didn't seem realistic. I don't think that is too much of a spoiler for those who haven't read it. 
 Worth Quoting: 
 3.9% ""What did you tell [the principal] about me?"" ""How funny you are, and how kind and smart..."" ""Did you tell him anything else?"" I said. Mom smiled at me. Her smile kind of hugged me. ""I told him about all your surgeries, and how brave you are,"" she said. 
 16.7% ""Jack whispered: ""Do you ever want to beat those kids up?"" I shrugged, ""I guess. I don't know."" ""I'd want to. I think you should get a secret squirt gun or something and attach it to your eyes somehow. An every time someone stares at you, you would squirt them in the face."" ""With some green slime or something,"" I answered. ""No, no: with slug juice mixed with dog pee."" 
 20.2% ""I've though about this a lot,"" said the second mummy, sounding serious, ""and I really think...if I looked like him, seriously, I think that I'd kill myself."" ""You would not,"" answered Darth Sidious. ""Yeah, for real."" insisted the same mummy. ""I can't imagine looking in that mirror everyday and seeing myself like that. It would be too awful. And getting stared at all the time."" ""Then why do you hang out with him so much?"" asked Darth Sidious. ""I don't know,"" answered the mummy...The mummy shrugged. I knew the shrug, of course. I knew the voice. I knew I wanted to run out of the class right then and there. 
 22.5% Coming home after four weeks felt very strange at first. I remember very vividly stepping through the door and seeing August running over to welcome me home, and for this tiny fraction of a moment I saw him not the way I've always seen him, but the way other people see him. It was only a flash, an instant while he was hugging me, so happy that I was home, but it surprised me because I'd never seen him like that before. And I'd never felt what he was feeling before, either; a feeling I hated myself for having the moment I had it. But as he was kissing me with all his heart, all I could see was the drool coming down his chin. And suddenly there I was, like all those people who would stare or look away. Horrified. Sickened. Scared. Thankfully, that only lasted for a second: the moment I heard August laugh his raspy little laugh it was over. Everything was back the way it had been before. But it had opened a door for me. A little peephole. And on the other side of the peephole there were two Augusts; the one I saw blindly, and the one other people saw. 
 22.8% ""I love Auggie very, very much,"" [my grandmother] said softly...""But he has many angels looking out for him already, Via. And I want you to know that you have me looking out for you.""...She looked out at the ocean and spread her hands out like she was trying to smooth out the waves. ""You are my everything. You understand me, Via?""...I understood her. And I knew why she said it was a secret. Grandmothers aren't supposed to have favorites. Everyone knows that. But after she died, I held onto that secret and let it cover me like a blanket. 
 28.8% [T]he phone rang. It was the nurse from August's school calling...So much for the old movies and mother-daughter bonding. Mom picked August up, and the moment he came home, he went straight to the bathroom and threw up. Then he went to his bed and pulled the covers over his head. Mom took his temperature, brought him some hot tea, and assumed the ""August's mom"" role again. ""Via's mom,"" who had come out for a little while, was put away. I understood, though: August was in bad shape. 
 31.3% It was actually because I was playing Four Square with August that I found out about the Plague. Apparently this is a ""game"" that's been going on since the beginning of the year. Anyone who accidently touches August has only thirty seconds to wash their hands or find hand sanitizer before they catch the Plague. I'm not sure what happens to you if you actually catch the Plague because nobody's touched August yet - not directly...I told Maya that was really dumb and she agreed, but she still wouldn't touch a ball that August just touched, not if she could help it. 
 33.6% ""You want to know what's wrong with my face?...The main thing I have is this thing called man-di-bu-lo-facial dys-os-tosis - which took me forever to learn how to pronounce, by the way. But I also have this other syndrome thing that I can't even pronounce. And these things kind of just morphed together into one big superthing, which is so rare they don't even have a name for it. I mean, I don't want to brag or anything, but I'm actually considered something of a medical wonder, you know."" He smiled. ""That was a joke,"" he said. ""You can laugh."" 
 40.2% ""While you're at home, you take the time to think about what's happened. And if you want to write me a letter explaining what happened, and a letter to Julian apologizing, then we won't even put any of this in your permanent record, okay?"" [Ah, the old Permanent Record we all feared having negative marks on when we were in school.] 
 50.4% olivia reminds me of a bird sometimes, how her feathers get all ruffled when she's mad. and when she's fragile like this, she's a little lost bird looking for it's nest. so i give her my wing to hide under. 
 53.1% How can I describe what I heard when the doctor turned on my hearing aids? Or what I didn't hear? It's too hard to think of words. The ocean just wasn't living inside my head anymore. It was gone. I could hear sounds like shiny lights in my brain. It was like when you're in a room where one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling isn't working, but you don't realize how dark it is until someone changes the lightbulb and then you're like, whoa, it's so bright in here! I don't know if there's a word that means the same as ""bright"" in terms of hearing, but I wish I knew one, because my ears were hearing brightly now. 
 56% ""Mommy, is Daisy with Grans now?"" ""I think so."" ""Are they in heaven?"" ""Yes."" ""Do people look the same when they get to heaven?"" ""I don't know. I don't think so."" ""Then how do people recognize each other?"" ""I don't know, sweetie."" She sounded tired. ""They just feel it. You don't need your eyes to love, right? You just feel it inside you. That's how it is in heaven. It's just love, and no on forgets who they love."" 
 67.7% Mr. Tushman and Ms. Rubin and Summer and all the rest of the kids were just watching the movie. They had no clue how something bad had almost happened to me and Jack. It's so weird how that can be, how you could have a night that's the worst in your life, but to everybody else it's just an ordinary night. Like, on my calendar at home, I would mark this as being one of the most horrific days of my life. This and the day Daisy died. But for the rest of the world, this was just an ordinary day. Or maybe it was even a good day. Maybe somebody won the lottery today. [This is how I felt after the Joplin tornado. Mom and I were trying to recover and other people were posting about ordinary days and flippant nuisances on Facebook. It felt like life should be in shambles for everyone and not just us because for us it was our whole world.] 
 85.9% ""I don't think it's for anyone else to judge the semantics of a note,"" said Mom. ""It doesn't matter whether you think one note is worse than the other - it's how the person reading the note reads it."" [This is why the law says reasonable person because some aren't reasonable.]","Mon Mar 03 09:28:31 -0800 2014","Tue Jan 13 21:21:18 -0800 2015","Tue Dec 16 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Sun Dec 14 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,1,"True"

 I found this book to be compulsively readable and I enjoyed every moment of it. I thought the message was important and timely and I am glad that this book has experienced the popularity that it has. I am going to add this to the list of books to read or listen to with my kids. 
 Having said that, I felt that the book was wrapped up SLIGHTLY too sweetly. The characters all had believable, clear voices, but I felt that some of the negative emotions that would exist in this reality were downplayed just a tad. I understand why that author took this approach, as this is a book aimed for children. I guess I wanted just a little more emotional oomph (although there was enough to bring a tear to my eye a time or two). 
 Overall - I think this book was very effective at providing a glimpse into August's world and is a good edition to the current childhood canon.","Thu Oct 25 06:59:15 -0700 2012","Wed Jun 14 13:14:56 -0700 2017","Wed Jun 14 13:14:56 -0700 2017","Thu Jun 08 10:05:33 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Have you caught your best friend trash-talking you just to be on the popular side? Have you ever thought how those people WONDER? WONDER why they badly care? WONDER why don't they get the deal obviously? WONDER why they don't accept people as who they are?WONDER why should they waste time mumbling in and out of the business of others? WONDER why they lack the sense of sensitivity? If I would have the time to jot down the WONDERS I had during and after I have read this...it would take forever. 
 This WONDERful story started with August Pullman -- the child that was born with unusual sickness, the mandibulofacial dysostosis caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the TCOF1 gene, which is located on chromosome 5, complicated by a hemifacial microsomia characteristic of OAV spectrum, in simpler words, his face's sickly deformed. Auggie's parents, Isabel and...I forgot his dad's name were forced to homeschool him for years. One time, they decided to enroll Auggie to school but only if Auggie says he's ready. And unexpectedly, Auggie agreed for he know what sort of trouble and pain he will get into. But what surprised Auggie was the pain brought by the one he trusts. 
 Auggie has better senses than any normal human being. I wouldn't call it a supernatural power or chemically created power brought by the surgeries he had but, he has the unique ability to see things and keep it really quietly because he exclusively understands (It kind of reminds me of being a wallflower actually). Moreover, as a child, he knows his place, he knows what's happening and he never argues with it (well, maybe sometimes...you know every child has tantrums and a blasted curious minds). 
 Going beyond the story, I really have this urge to comment about being RUDE. If you see a man with an unusual face, would you actually tell your friend or the person beside you ""hey, the man looks weird, he has long mustache and a big nose and all"" barefacedly? I mean, what are you trying to get?! What could you possibly get from destroying a person's ego? If you can't help it, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO ACT AMBIGUOUSLY? I mean come on! Haven't you heard the thing called ""SELF-RESPECT""? 
 Lastly, a unique boy like Auggie sees what we see and feels what we feel (if you know what I mean) that's why we better not judge that boy by his face. Heck, we better NOT JUDGE ANYONE without knowing who he/she is and regardless of his/her status in life.","Sun Nov 04 05:19:49 -0800 2012","Thu Nov 08 05:26:15 -0800 2012","Wed Nov 07 07:35:19 -0800 2012","Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 -0800 2012",7,1,"False"

The back cover blurb says 'Don't judge a boy by his face', but we all do this every day. Perhaps it just strikes a chord with me, because my own daughter was born with a facial disfigurement. I can still remember how people used to look at her. 
 This story is told by the boy himself, Auggie, a wonderful, feisty little character you can't help but fall in love with, and those people closest to him. Aged 10, and home-schooled, Auggie begins prep school, and this story follows him through the trials and tribulations of that first year. 
 Be warned, there are moments when you will be reduced to a weeping wreck, but others where you will be smiling with joy. There is nothing depressing about this story, it is warm-hearted and uplifting. 
 'I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds.' That's how Auggie begins his story. 'I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.' 
 He goes on to tell how the other children at school recoiled when they first saw him, how they stared and whispered behind his back; wouldn't sit beside him, or touch him, for fear of catching 'the plague'; how the kids he thought were his friends were only looking out for him because they were told to by teachers; how he was physically attacked and bullied by older kids, who should have known better. 
 The story is told simply, directly, and you can't help rooting for him. His family are loving and supportive, but even they struggle at times to cope with the impact his syndrome is having upon them, and it's interesting to read their experiences of having Auggie in their lives, both good and bad. 
 But with a group of parents campaigning to have him removed from the school, and his friends being bullied simply for being his pals, it's hard to keep going, no matter how bright, resourceful and resilient Auggie is. 
 Sometimes funny, sometimes shocking, this is a story which will stay with you long after you've finished reading it.","Sun Sep 02 13:21:09 -0700 2012","Sun Sep 09 07:43:22 -0700 2012","Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 -0700 2012","Sun Sep 02 00:00:00 -0700 2012",0,0,""

I think it's targeting all people to face their real feelings and how they should treat all people regardless how they looks like. 
 Auggie is a kid who's been chosen by god to be special human being, though, will be seen as a handicapped with deforms. 
 From my view of point, I don't see him as handicapped kid, where he is smart with normal body and only having some face deforms and all other things can be overcome. 
 I've loved the way his mother handled the situation, how she pretend to be strong for him, of course she suffered a lot, thought she could manage to give him the life he deserves as she believes. 
 His sister in the novel teaches us all how she sacrificed for her brother, where Auggie needs her parents more than her. Though, she needs them and misses them. 
 In the school, too many lessons learnt, it's been highlighted how people feels towards someone like Auggie, and nobody should be judged of how they looked like, because under the appearance there is heart and feelings. 
 There are more to comment on this great novel, but let it be easy, simple and short :)

The main character, 10 year old August Pullman, is born with a facial deformity that makes people look away in horror and keeps him out of public schools until the beginning of 5th grade, when the book begins. He opens the narration of the book and says, ""I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse."" His parents decide he is ready to face the stresses of Beecher Prep School. His entrance into the mainstream is supposed to be softened by his introduction to Jack, Julian and Charlotte, young ""leaders"" chosen by the principal to show Auggie around the school before the year begins. Of course, children don't become friends simply because adults want them to, and kids are cruel - a lesson Auggie must learn time and time again. Wonder has won many ""best book"" accolades and been described as one that will make children and adults treat others better. I loved Auggie and wanted to cheer him on in the truthful, sad sections of the book that he narrates. I thought the narrative structure was weakened by the alternative voices used by the author - various friends, and Auggie's sister, Olivia. I felt these other narrators did little more than re-narrate the same events rather than advancing the plot. But there are so many other positives about the book, one of which is the Choose Kind pledge on a Tumblr site advocating the book's anti-bullying mission. Also, I really loved the Precepts used by one of the teachers to frame his instruction for the year -

 When I first started to read Wonder, I had no expectations what so ever. A 10 year old boy with a deformed face wasn't someone I imagined becoming so compassionate about. 
 But the futher I came into the book, the more intrigued I became. It became nearly impossible to stop reading. It definitely touches a sensitive subject; our obsession of beauty. Something that is so important in our world, which makes us often forget not to judge a boy by his face. Wonder teaches us the importance of family and friendship, but most of all kindness.","Sun Nov 03 05:00:40 -0800 2013","Sun Dec 01 17:05:15 -0800 2013","","",0,0,""

I couldn't put it down until I found out how Auggie's story was resolved. As I read this story I felt heartbroken, sympathetic, angry, and hopeful. I liked all of the characters (except for Julian and his family!!) and the way the author made readers consider their perspectives and the different ways Auggie's condition affected them. I especially got a lot out of the chapters narrated by Via. Although Auggie was the one who had to live with his condition, Via's life was affected in tremendous ways and I saw her as an extremely strong and admirable character. 
 I recommend this book to young and old readers alike, especially if you're uncomfortable with someone who looks a little different. It'll give you some insight and hopefully some empathy as well. After I read the book I went to the author's website: 
 http://rjpalacio.com/index.html

 Meet August Pullman. He was given the short straw and has had to live with the consequences. Auggie is your ordinary, humorous, kind hearted, smart fifth grader...except he was born with a facial abnormality. A severe facial abnormality that has been the cause of unwanted attention since he could remember. 
 Up until the start of the book Auggie's parents have homeschooled him; however, now they decide he's ready for a real, formal education. When the first day of fifth grade arrives, Auggie not so confidently passes through the doors of Beecher Prep, not sure what he'll find on the other side. Luckily, Beecher Prep is a great school with an approachable principal, creative teachers, and some out of this world students! But, like all schools, Auggie must struggle through making true friends, dealing with bullies, and learning all the new rules of school. Imagine how hard it'd be for you to start a new school in fifth grade; now think about having to start a new school with a mismatched face. 
 What I Liked: I couldn't put this book down! It took me two days to read it cover to cover. First, this book is ""raw"". All of the scenarios could and do really happen, many to students without facial abnormalities. The author doesn't sugar coat...there were times (many times) I gasped to myself while reading! Second, the friendships that were built throughout the book were heart warming. It was great to see/read that students weren't just being nice because Auggie was ""different"" but because of his true personality. Third, having other narrations throughout the book deepened the entire plot. I loved hearing what Auggie's sister thought about the entire situation, and Jack's feelings too. 
 What Could Have Been Better: No comment. I thought this book was exceptional. I felt like I was part of the family from the beginning and only hope that there will be a sequel! 
 Who Should Read This Book: I believe all ages will thoroughly enjoy this book. Another great book to read with a parent. If you've ever felt left out, bullied, or just plain ugly, you'll be able to relate to Auggie. Auggie will become you're new best bud and I can predict you'll be just as bummed as I was when it's over as I was.","Sun Oct 06 14:52:35 -0700 2013","Thu Apr 03 16:48:12 -0700 2014","","",0,0,""

 I think this book was okay. There were many parts that I find weren't ""realistic"". For example the part about August being dissed by everyone at school (except for Jack and Summer), which I think in life is not possible because people would actually be a lot more sympathetic. Or when his photo was photoshopped from the yearbook (I mean WHAT?? No parent would be that stupid and shallow, seriously-.-). Also on how it is difficult to be Via with a brother like that..especially the part when Miranda asked if Justin was 'okay' with it...I mean why wouldn't he? It's not like August would affect their relationship in any kind of way? Unless August was a brat who kept bothering Justin, but he's not. So I think things like that are too exaggerated which kind of kills the plausibility. This could've been a great book. In the end though, I would still recommend it to my friends and family :)","Tue Jul 01 17:49:22 -0700 2014","Tue Jul 01 18:19:49 -0700 2014","Tue Jul 01 00:00:00 -0700 2014","",0,0,""

 At first, I didn't know what to expect. It was about 5th graders, which I'm not used to read about. But as soon as you get to know auggie: you fall in love.

Coddled by his parents for years, he is thrown from homeschooling to fifth grade, middle school. During his first year he meets an assortment of people, friends like Summer and Jack, and crueler students like Julian and Henry. August's appearance at first scares students, but by the end he shows them that people are more than skin deep. 
 Overall, I really liked this book. It was an easy read and the change in point of view was very refreshing. I think the book perfectly captured the essence of ten year old boys and girls, and the hardships of being different. While a huge part of the book focused on the adage ""don't judge a book by its cover"" I saw the overall theme as the importance of kindness. Everyone in the book is happier when they are kinder, which translates into real life. Being kind isn't hard, and it is always rewarding. I don't think there's any content too strong for a middle school school or older, and I think someone reading it that is the same age as August could connect to him in a way I couldn't.","Tue May 20 16:33:32 -0700 2014","Sat May 31 11:14:37 -0700 2014","","",0,0,""

 http://www.reachandteach.com/s/wonder 
 Here's an excerpt of the review: 
 Masterfully crafted and impossible to put down, this book should be required reading for anyone over the age of ten. Augie, like Alex Libby, is an amazing person with fascinating interests, incredible courage, a wickede sense of humor, loving compassion for others, a willingness to forgive other people's weaknesses and bad behavior, and he can be a lot of fun to be around if you take the time to get past the surface. Augie, though, unlike Alex, has such severe deformities that it takes a lot more work to get past his surface. The story takes you all the way through his first full year at school. One minute you'll be laughing out loud about something that happens and the next minute you'll be crying. A minute later you'll be incredibly angry. The author takes you on a roller coaster of emotions without being heavy handed. 
 Fans of The Neverending Story know that a good book can make you feel like you are the main character. As Augie, you fearfully wonder if anyone will let you sit near them in the lunchroom. You feel betrayed when your best friend says something terrible about you behind your back. You fret that your own sister doesn't want you to come to her school play because she's tired of the spotlight always being on you. Within just a few paragraphs you ARE Augie. 
 Then, R.J. Palacio shakes things up. Suddenly you start to experience being other people in Augie's life: his best friend, his sister, her friend, six other characters in all. This is critically important. Told differently this story could have made you feel very sorry for Augie and furious at the other characters, but you might not see yourself in the circle of people around him. Without getting into the other characters' skin and seeing things through THEIR eyes you might unwittingly continue be part of the problem of bullying instead of being part of the solution. With Wonder, you get to see how one little thing that you do can cause unbelievable pain, or how another tiny simple thing can bring great joy. 
 That was also a message clearly learned by the people who had seen Bully. Every single person in the room had either been bullied or had witnessed another person being bullied. Some admitted to having engaged in bullying against others. Over half, though, despite being witnesses to bullying, had never taken action to stop someone from bullying. Virtually everyone in the room pledged to become ""upstanders instead of bystanders."" 
 Wonder brings that message home more clearly than any other novel I have read about bullying. One criticism I've seen about the book (spoiler alert) is that it has a happy ending. We know that many bullying stories end in tragedy. One of my greatest coming out gripes was that just about every book about growing up gay ended with the gay person getting beaten up, murdered, or committing suicide. Yes, that can and does happen, but it doesn't have to. My hope is that someone who reads this book will realize that one simple act of kindness, one moment of being a little extra mindful, simply looking at someone long enough to catch their eye and then smiling (which prevented one contemplated suicide that I know of) or giving someone an awkward little wave, or letting an adult know that a child is in terrible pain, could mean the difference between life and death. 
 Augie's fictional story has a happy ending. Alex Libby is really happy with his life now that he has moved to a new home and new school and has been warmly accepted by the people in his new town. Any child can make the difference between happy endings and heartbreaks. Wonder empowers children to make that difference. Simply taking a seat in the lunchroom next to another kid who looks all alone can be a huge gift (and you may find that your next year of lunches are much more fun than they would have been at some other table). We each have the power to transform someone else's world, and at the same time, our own. Sometimes that transformation starts when someone hands you a book and says ""you've got to read this."" 
 Wonder is among the best books I've ever read and I hope that it becomes even more widely read by children than the Harry Potter series. Real children can't ride a broomstick and win the Tri-Wizard Cup, but they can do amazing magic to keep other children safe and happy.

The birth defects affects what his face looks like. He's had many different surgeries to try and help his face deformities. Now his parents want him to go to school for 5th grade. He's been home schooled his whole life. He has to get ready to face the 6th grade bullies and nice kids. He goes to Beecher Prep and makes some friends in Summer and Jack Will. But he also finds some mean kids in Julian. August ends up fighting through it with friends and at the end of the year, wins the Henry Ward Beecher award for courage and bravery. In the end he finds more nice people than mean people. 
 Some things I liked about this book are that it was really interesting to see what August, and other kids who have to deal with this kind of stuff, has to deal with throughout the school year. Some things I didn't really like were that some of the things kid said and did don't really correspond to their age. I don't think at 5th grade some kids would say what they said in the book. What I'm saying is that it is kind of unrealistic what the kids were saying. 
 I would recommend this book to boys and girls. I think I was a little bit too old to read this book. It was a really easy read for me so I would recommend this book to some younger audiences.","Sun Jan 08 18:58:18 -0800 2017","Sun Jan 08 18:58:18 -0800 2017","","",0,0,""

It's also a great book to read and discuss in class for grades 4 and up. Palacio does a great job talking from her protagonists point of view, and I did love hearing directly from this sister as well as some of the other characters, but there were perhaps a few too many POVs. August is an exceptional human being in every sense of the word. The juxtaposition of his own vision of himself and his life compared to that of his older sisters presents a wonderful view into the complicated life of a family with a special child. Every note of these intertwined stories rang true. 
 I admit to being disappointed that the parents played such a relatively small role in the story. Though we hear directly from almost every other character (major and minor), but we are curiously never allowed into the parent's inner world. Likewise, I felt that parents who had been so involved in every minute detail of this child's traumatic life, but pretty much left him to fend for himself in his first year of school. Those minor criticisms do not take away from the wonder of reading this book and sharing it with my children. It opened a lot of interesting, intense discussions, as we also have a special needs child in our family.","Mon Sep 24 17:34:42 -0700 2012","Mon Sep 24 17:46:16 -0700 2012","Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""

He has been homeschooled by his mom due to the huge number of surgeries he had to endure since he was a baby. Auggie was born with a severe birth defect enforcing him to deal with more than 20 surgeries in just under ten years. He knows how people look at him whenever they go out, and he's scared of what will happen when he enter the normal school - he won't know anyone there. What if the kids are afraid of him? What if they hate him? Will he have any friends? 
 Anyways, when Auggie's parents take him to Beecher Prep, just a few blocks away from his place to meet the principal, Mr. Tushman, he decides to give it a try. Besides, if it's too bad, he always has the choice to give up and go back to being home-schooled. In the school, he actually has plenty of problems, yet, he also has some of true friends that interact with him no matter how he look like to them. I love Auggie's family, it taught me that no matter how hard your life seems to be, family is the number one people that always stay with you when the world against you. 
 This story also told from multiple viewpoints, and not once does it feel disconnected. In fact, the multiple points of view help plot out the novel very well. I've read some of books about bullying, unfortunate people, and stuffs like that but I don't think I've ever wanted to jump in and save someone as badly as I did with Auggie. This little guy has a very beautiful heart the readers can't help but like and love him. While this is a middle-grade novel, it think it's perfectly suited for any age. In fact, I would suggest kids, teens and adults to read it. It's well-written, powerful and has an important insights for all of us. It teaches us that the true beauty does not rely on pretty faces. but it is found through a pretty heart. Auggie Pullman and his family taught me that sometimes, perfection is boring. Bullying is seriously a bad thing. Miracle does happen and love can change anything. and Auggie, is definitely a wonder.

 August an active and a sportive child joins Beecher prep school despite his reluctance and initial agitation. He meets a confused Jack, a friendly Summer and a neutral Charlotte. Loads of surprises holds his patience and peace of mind. The usual bully at school involving julian and his mates leaves him angry and sad despite his high level of positivity. 
 Agusts' family supports him to his best behaviour and stand by his side facing all the challenges and tribulations. A medical facial deformity, yet a strong heart keeps him going despite all the odds.This story highlights the challenges faced by the child and the people around him and brings out a great message to every single person out there that ""A GOOD CHARACTER HOLDS IMMENSE STRENGTH"" 
 Ultimately it speaks about the child rearing that every parent should hold in mind and the necessary steps they need to take to direct the child to the positive light

First of all, it's pretty great. One of my new favorites even. There's tons of ups and downs, much like real life and the changing character viewpoints make you see August from different perspectives, and because the story revolves around August's appearance and how others perceive him I thought it was pretty clever. Here comes the confusing part. While I was reading (especially towards the end) I was a little irked at how perfect everything was falling into place. Don't get me wrong, I love a happy ending but it was a little too perfect- a sunshine, rainbows, and lollipops type of ending. Normally, this would be enough to change my view on the book almost entirely because after all, what's more upsetting than a disappointing ending? However, after rethinking the message of Wonder which is essentially kindness and self-acceptance, I realized the ending is pretty... well, perfect. What's better than sending out a positive message to readers, especially young readers, who the book is aimed at. This books is the definition of teaching that courage, love, and optimism will always be rewarded.

Because for some reason, I feel like a curmudgeon for taking away a star and that I have to over-explain my reasoning. So, let's just start with the positive: 
 This is a great Young Readers novel that expertly exhibits what it's like to look or be different from what is considered ""normal"" and how we need to not only be nice to other people who are ""different"" from us but also appreciate them for who they are beyond what makes them ""different."" This is an important lesson for anyone at any age, but I think it's especially important for children who often lack a filter when they first encounter something or someone that is different from what they have seen or experienced before. I would recommend that this book be required (or at the least highly recommended) reading for kids just because it has such a positive message. 
 Also, it's very well-written on top of the positive message. The writing flows well and it's easy to read this book in a day. The characters are all engaging and well-written. I appreciate that the book reached beyond just Auggie's difficulties trying to live a ""normal"" life and showcased characters like Summer, Auggie's sweet-natured friend who is being raised in a single parent home after her dad's tragic death, and Jack, another of Auggie's school friends who is a poor kid at a rich kid's school. Auggie is obviously the main character and these side characters revolve around him, but I love that there is a deeper level to explore. Even though Auggie has the most obstacles to overcome in order to feel like he fits in, all of the other characters are dealing with something negative in their life that they struggle to turn into something positive. 
 The reason why I can't give this book the solid five stars is because I wish we could have gotten more about Summer, Jack, Miranda (Auggie's sister's friend), and Justin (Auggie's sister's new boyfriend). They all have their own POV chapters...and then that's it. There's no resolution to the things they are dealing with. I get that this isn't their story, but I kind of hated that the author introduces these emotional dimensions to them and then just relegates them to be another way of someone viewing Auggie. 
 I also thought the main antagonist (Julian) was too one-dimensional. I get that kids can be horrible, but after reading these other side stories, I kept expecting that we would see why Julian is so terrible to Auggie. Instead, the only explanation we get is that his parents are also stuck up and awful. I didn't expect a heel-face turn, but I at least wanted to see a little bit more depth to his character. 
 Overall, despite my criticisms, I do believe that this is an important book that children need to read. It's heart is continually in the right place, and the characters seem so real and grounded. If I was a teacher, I would definitely teach this in my classroom. Since I'm not, I will have to be content with passing it off on my nieces and nephews instead.","Sat Sep 09 08:02:10 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 11 15:51:29 -0700 2017","Mon Sep 11 15:51:29 -0700 2017","Sat Sep 09 08:02:10 -0700 2017",0,0,""

Fin da piccolo Auggie e stato sottoposto a svariate operazioni e ricoveri in ospedale e non ha mai frequentato la scuola, fino a quando la madre decide che e giunto il tempo per lui di frequentarla e lo iscrive per cominciare la prima media. Ovviamente per Auggie la cosa e fonte di grandissima ansia e tantissime preoccupazioni ma tra alti e bassi (tra i quali, l'essere costantemente fissato e indicato da tutti) il primo anno scorre e Auggie, i suoi genitori, la sorella Via e gli amici (vecchi e nuovi) impareranno qualcosa di nuovo. Il punto forte del libro e il fatto che le vicende siano raccontate da vari punti di vista: quello di Auggie, ma anche quello di Via e di altri personaggi.

Nell'istante stesso in cui mi sono appoggiata, la bambina si e alzata di scatto e prima che fuggisse le ho chiesto cosa stesse leggendo (I diari di Nikki. ndr). Probabilmente era un soggetto particolarmente timido, in caso contrario dovrei considerare l'idea che forse la mia faccia sembra quella di un pedofilo. Fatto sta che mi e venuto in mente August Pullman, il protagonista di ""Wonder"" affetto dalla sindrome di Treacher Collins, che proprio a causa della faccia ha difficolta a essere accettato. A dieci anni finge di non accorgersi di come la gente abbassa gli occhi quando incrocia il suo sguardo o degli urli involontari di stupore, ma se prima poteva nascondersi al sicuro nella propria casa, adesso che iniziera la prima media dovra imparare a farsi valere. 
 A fine lettura il mio cuore ha detto ""crack"" e sono d'accordo con lui. C'e qualcosa, in questo romanzo, che lo rende speciale. Non tanto la tematica della malattia e dell'accettazione o lo stile semplice, quanto piuttosto la presenza di piu punti di vista. Il libro si divide infatti in piu parti ciascuna narrata da un personaggio in particolare, col risultato che ""Wonder"" non e solo la storia di August ma anche la storia della sorella Olivia, dell'amico Jack, di Miranda, Summer e via dicendo. Il miscuglio di vite che ne deriva si converte in un miscuglio di emozioni (mi ha toccata particolarmente l'introspezione di Olivia, costretta ad affrontare l'adolescenza all'ombra del fratello minore). Immedesimarsi diventa ancora piu semplice ed immedesimarsi in una storia cosi difficile puo aiutarci a considerare la realta con occhi diversi. Da leggere assolutamente.","Thu Aug 11 14:33:09 -0700 2016","Wed Sep 07 09:26:08 -0700 2016","Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0,""

 From what i read, Palacio has a sort of touch and go style of writing where she would talk about an issue and then just dabble about it without offering a resolution.

 I have finally read this book after seeing reviews on here and on YouTube. 
 Frankly, I did not enjoy it as much as the others on here did. 
 Here are a few things that I like about the book: 
 1. The book contains a few stories of each character. When I first started, I have always thought 
 it is only going to be about August.Yet, it turns out to be about the characters around him as well which makes it more interesting to read:) 
 2. It's just SO happy for me to see how August changed from when he's unwilling to go to school to where he was at the end of the book. It's an enlightening story. 
 Yet, one thing that I did not like and why this book is only 4 stars is that, in my opinion, it is not realistic enough. I saw some people say about this on here as well. How August does not sound like a fifth grader, but the same age as Via , who is way older than him. I know no book can be perfect and it's impossible for the author to do so, but it's just one thing that I do not like about the book and why I only gave it a 4 stars. 
 But other than that, this book is unique, fun and interesting. Definitely a good one to read if you want a break from all those similar YA books:)","Thu May 29 04:11:44 -0700 2014","Sun Jun 01 08:44:17 -0700 2014","Sun Jun 01 08:44:17 -0700 2014","Thu May 29 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0,""

 Well its not good. 
 The writing is smooth, the concept is awful ""be kind"" don't make me laugh being overly kind to people with special needs your being an awful human being cause you're being fake to them, do you know that's frustrating to them not being treated like other people always being this ""special"" kid.

Perfect for middle grade readers, it will pull in anyone who picks it up, and won't let go until the last page is turned... and long after. 
 Wonder himself is a wonderfully (heh) normal kid, who just happens to have a face that makes people pause. The story starts with his own point of view, explaining in a matter-of-fact way how he looks ""probably worse than you imagine"", and his nervousness about entering school for the first time after being homeschooled his whole life. (He'll be in 5th grade, incidentally.) 
 Wonder takes the reader through many of the basic storyline arcs of great middle grade books before it, such as Beverly Cleary's ""Ramona"" books, and Judy Blume's Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, but with a twist. Wonder goes to school, makes friends makes enemies, dresses up for Halloween, goes on a field trip, etc. But because of his unique look, the everyday takes on a stark realism for anyone who has ever felt like an outcast... and then it changes, and takes the reader even beyond that. 
 Points of view shift, and suddenly the reader is in the minds of those ""normal"" people who are effected by Wonder's place in their own lives: his sister, his friends, even his sister's boyfriend. With each point of view, the reader gains more of a deep, abiding worldview beyond Wonder himself, and thus, beyond their own selves as well. 
 I can't say enough how amazing this book is. Read it. Everyone should read it. I don't care if it's hyped... it deserves it. It deserves everything it can get, and R.J. Palacio is a genius.","Fri May 17 16:09:23 -0700 2013","Fri May 17 16:27:01 -0700 2013","Sun May 19 00:00:00 -0700 2013","",0,0,""

 The most interesting thing to me was the constant switching of points of view. You get to read everyone's side to the story, and it shows how kids can be bullies sometimes without even realizing it. Auggie acts just like you would expect an under-sized, bullied kid with a disease that deforms his face to act. Jack acts exactly like you would expect a semi-popular 10-year-old to act. Basically, everyone is a pretty accurate portrayal of who they would be in real life.

 Wonder e un libro molto dolce, uno di quei libri che e giusto leggere, perche insegna ad essere gentili e la gentilezza, al giorno d'oggi, non e mai troppa. 
 Ci sono tante cose che mi sono piaciute in questo libro, in primo luogo il protagonista: August e davvero speciale, e simpatico e divertente e coglie spesso l'occasione per scherzare su tutto, persino sul suo aspetto. Questo rende la lettura piacevole e scorrevole e fa si che Auggie non appaia mai come una vittima. 
 Credo che questa sia una cosa fondamentale: August e un bambino esattamente come tutti gli altri, pensa e agisce come tutti gli altri, solo che ha una faccia un po' diversa. 
 Inoltre e estremamente intelligente e buono, ama incondizionatamente la sua famiglia e i suoi amici, e ben presto, attraverso questa storia, ci insegna che l'aspetto esteriore non conta affatto, quando si e belli dentro. 
 Un concetto scontato? Non credo.

Which made me a little irritated at times ' the world doesn't revolve around you' is very true but he's still a child and has time to learn and grown and I think as an teen and adult he will be a very compassionate and brilliant person.","Sun Feb 19 03:49:19 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 19 10:37:02 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 19 10:37:02 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 19 03:49:20 -0800 2017",0,0,""

 This is one of the books you want to (and most likely will) read in one-sitting. 
 When I first read the synopsis of this book, I was intrigued. Let me begin by saying this was the first book I read in a long time. I wanted something different to reignite my love for reading again. After finishing this book, I can say this book definitely did that. Like others have mentioned, the characters in this book made me feel nostalgic. 
 August is an innocent, kind-hearted and ordinary boy with an extraordinary boy. He's just seeking to fit in and be like everybody else. However, his outwardly appearance makes it difficult for other kids to genuinely get to know him. The book addresses a lot of important issues about self-esteem, bullying, depression, pet death and coming of age. 
 I think this is the type of book I wish I read in middle school. It inspires us to be more compassionate. 
 Reading this book made me cry, laugh and think. It was witty without trying to hard to be. It maintained its innocent charm while talking about serious topics. As a reader, I felt so much compassion for August. Here he was, in a situation he had no control over. Yet, his resilience and optimism is inspiring to even the oldest reader.","Sat Mar 04 22:05:19 -0800 2017","Sat Mar 04 22:19:02 -0800 2017","Sun Mar 05 22:19:03 -0800 2017","",0,0,""

I mean, there is finally other people's points of views, making the story less boring and one sided (and I really hate one sided books, which don't give a chance for the other characters to make their points clear, because there is always more to an antagonist than just being 'bad' in a well written book). 
 But to be really honest, there are some times that I really don't like August, because sometimes he just gives up and wants attention and extra care from his parents, and times that he is so stubborn that it kind of annoys me. I mean I understand WHY he feels these ways, and it's because he is hurt, but sometimes you just have to stand up a little more for yourself. PLEASE don't scream at me, I'm just being honest. 
 Now, I have to say, my favourite character has to be Julian (you would know if you had the Julian chapter). Because I think in the end, he had such a better character improvement than anyone else, I mean ANYONE. I would have hated the book if he was just the 'common school bully who's rich and snooty to others' cliche, so I am really glad the author did this. 
 Overall I loved this book still.","Thu Aug 24 03:38:06 -0700 2017","Thu Aug 24 03:51:58 -0700 2017","Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 -0700 2017",0,0,""

 So why add another review to the internet of this already smash-hit, critically-acclaimed novel? Wonder the movie is hitting theaters next month, in case people haven't heard of it. I wanted to read it, but I wasn't sure if I'd take the time to review it. That changed once I started. As a middle school teacher--as a human being--I must champion R.J. Palacio's timeless message. Some books deserve the hype, and Wonder lives up to its name. Parents, your kids must read this book. Read this book with your kids even, then discuss it as a family. It's rare to find literature that distills the complicated themes of life into such simple truths, and a novel that does so makes a powerful treasure. 
 Born with a facial deformity, 5th grader August Pullman enrolls in a private school to attend classes outside his home for the first time. While adults do their best to not notice and students make no secret of their curiosity and horror, Auggie wants nothing more than to just be ordinary. Soon Julian, a teacher's pet when instructors are looking and a horrible bully when they're not, leads a charge to ostracize the new student, and even the friends Auggie thinks he can count on wear masks of their own. Meanwhile, Auggie's sister Via struggles to adjust to a new high school and the pains of growing up. The point of view changes as the narrative unfolds, allowing the voices of Auggie's classmates to intersect and craft a heart-wrenching tour of empathy and human dignity. Written at the middle-grade level, this beautiful coming-of-age story speaks to kids and adults alike. 
 Told in short vignettes with a relatable middle school voice, Palacio's novel captures the rapid change-of-subject and constant ups and downs of life from a kid's point of view. Readers hear first from Auggie, then from his sister Via--whose section beautifully depicts the mess of compassion and resentment that comes with having a sibling who needs special care--and then from the perspectives of two of Auggie's schoolmates, Via's boyfriend, and her ex-best friend. Some expanded editions even include the ebook known as The Julian Chapter, giving voice to Auggie's main tormentor. 
 Nothing about the story feels forced or contrived. Palacio builds her narrative on ordinary conflicts: shifting friend groups, arguments with parents, a sick family dog. Put together, the chapters touch on all aspects of identity from race and class to which lunch table a student belongs. At times I wanted a bit more pep in the plot; nothing terrifying or particularly unusual happens, especially when compared to other classic novels of its type. Yet the pedestrian tour of Auggie's universe works to extend its humanity. While one might think Wonder is just a metaphor for how we all feel like the outcast sometimes, it bravely goes beyond that expectation by featuring themes about kindness and courage. The other narrators see just as much transformation as August does, and at times they're even more likeable. Creative in form and content, Wonder is a twenty-first-century tale that bridges gaps across generations, fighting for every kid to take a turn in the spotlight. Recommended for middle school and high elementary school readers, especially for class or book reports.","Tue Oct 17 16:21:28 -0700 2017","Tue Oct 17 16:23:25 -0700 2017","","",0,0,""

It's not merely about the incidents of the novel itself, but for making us in the shoe of those kind of people who face problems in this world for a 'defect' they are not responsible for. 
 It was nice to be in the mind of a deformed child, to know how he perceives the world around him, the challenges he face when people- both adults and children- give him the face of astonishment and detest. 
 I always wondered of how children with Down syndrome think of people around them. I had that cousin who passed away at his teenage. Because his face always seemed smiling, I keep thinking how he think or wether he understand when some people look at him with disgrace, does he feel it, is he aware of what some might say! Of course he wasn't like August, the kid in the novel, but for a second I recalled his face and the common faces all kids with their deficiency have.

For the most part, I'm still feeling tantram-y about the general state of things in this regard. 
 HOWEVER-- 
 WONDER, by R.J. Palacio, goes a long way to correct this. 
 Let's face it: there are books and then, there are BOOKS! And, by the latter category, I mean those rare gems that not only captivate us but also change us---for the better---by us having had the good fortune to have read them. 
 WONDER is such a wonder. It tilted my orbit, just a touch, and here's why: 
 The story is about Auggie, a normal kid with a horrifying facial deformity. Yes, I said *deformity* although, like everyone else in the story, the impact of that word diminishes for the reader as we, too, get to know this remarkable little man. 
 The story unfolds through the eyes of first, Auggie, then in sections devoted to the people who know and love him. It's a study in perspective---how each character views and copes with the daunting challenges of everyday life when you're always the center of unwanted, and sometimes hostile, attention. 
 The writing is sublime perfection. Simple, and yet, so, so powerful. Palacio's voice carries the sophisticated eloquence needed to lift such a melancholy story into the realm of inspiration. 
 One of my favorite passages: 
 ""Why do I have to be so ugly, Mommy?"" I whispered. 
 ""No, baby, you're not..."" 
 ""I know I am."" 
 She kissed me all over my face. She kissed my eyes that came down too far. She kissed my cheeks that looked punched in. She kissed my tortoise mouth. She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can't change my face."" 
 My heart aches, just typing that. 
 There is so much wisdom in this book. I'm in no way surprised that so many have plucked pearls from its text. I am particularly fond of this one: 
 ""I think that there should be rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."" 
 Wouldn't we all be better people if we gave more of those and received at least one? 
 Read this book. You'll be grateful you did.","Mon Feb 27 15:13:59 -0800 2012","Thu May 31 10:30:02 -0700 2012","Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 -0800 2012",20,2,""

 Characters: Auggie is so cute and he breaks my heart. His accounts on his life in school and home. Geez...Auggie is also extremely funny and isn't afraid to laugh at his own condition. Though sometimes I just want to shelter him from the world, but I know that he needs the life experience in such a school setting and such. My favorite character in the book was I would have to say Summer. She was just so sweet that I got a tooth ache from her. I don't know what it was about her, but she's just one of those people who are good and that's it. They're made out of goodness. 
 Plot: This book is all about bullying and making friends and 5th grade and all the stuff that comes with it. Now we've all been there right? 5th grade was one of those years where you started to find yourself and such. But for Auggie as you can imagine it's 10x worse. It's the slow shift of kid's feelings, attitudes, and learning how to be kind to one another. It has good lessons that anyone of any age can learn from. I surely learned from this, and I've been through all the grade school learning and such. 
 Setting: This is set in New York City, modern times....not much I can say about it really...pretty average setting...eh...

It is a struggle for both Augie and his classmates as their worlds are turned upside down, testing their character. This book will at times will make you fume or cry, and question the ability of humans to transform themselves. 
 We don't find out until well into the book what Augie's face looks like, fittingly delivering the message that it's what's inside that counts. Is it a message that his classmates will come to understand?

 I love YA and especially good YA. 
 This story is about a 10 year old boy named August (Augie) Pullman. 
 He is a sweet young boy with a loving sister, mom, dad, dog and a rare autosomal congenital disorder. 
 So rare that it occurs in 1 out of 50,000 births. 
 Treacher Collins-Franceschetti Syndrome or mandibulofacial dysostosis. 
 Augie is home schooled until he is 10 when his mom thinks he should attend a ""real"" school. 
 The story of his 5th grade year is full of sorrow, tears, resentment, and finally friendship which knows no deformity. 
 Augie is a real hero. 
 He continuously puts one foot in front of the other and walks through his life. 
 Everyone should read this book to learn a little more about themselves and how they treat others. 
 A Must Read!!!!","Fri Feb 28 07:52:13 -0800 2014","Fri Feb 28 08:13:02 -0800 2014","","",6,2,""

This is undoubtedly right there on top of my all time favorites; and my honest answer for this is because I felt that the author could have done a lot more justice to such a strong central character as ""August Pullman"". Else I would have gladly without further a doubt gone ahead with a five starer. 
 I did go over the reviews by readers prior to picking up this book, and like one of the reviews said ""Wonder is one of those rare books that makes you want to hug everyone in it so tightly that they'll have no doubt about how much you love them...and beyond that, it also makes you want to reach out and hug the whole world."" quote unquote. And this seriously is true with R.J. Palacio's ""Wonder"". 
 Definitely a read that is worth the praise.","Sun Jan 20 23:25:31 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 20 23:44:34 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0,""

I like how the author did not sugar coat how people reacted to Auggie when they first saw him or even after they saw him a few times. RJ Palacio did a great job developing characters that you will fall in love with and that you will not like and hope they get a wake up call. I had to stop reading at the end because I was crying so hard, haven't read a book like this in a little while. I can't wait to share this with my students! I know it will make them better people and really think about how they treat and judge people.","Fri Mar 30 07:42:41 -0700 2012","Fri Mar 30 07:47:29 -0700 2012","Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0,""
